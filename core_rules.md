## What is SIRE?

SIRE is a 3d6 TTRPG system created by CJ Schrum to be a generic system used to play any kind of TTRPG. It was influenced by his near thirty years of table top games in nearly every ruleset created. 

> I used to play FATE I liked a lot of things about FATE, I hated FATE dice mechanics. I played a lot of Cepheus, Traveller, Decipher Star Trek, ModernAGE, West End Games Star Wars, and Sixfinity so lets say I have a lot of experience with D6 in my hands. So I set out to create a fairly generic style RPG using 3D6 (I like the curve better than the standard distribution of 2D6). Allowing for Advanatage Roll 3D6 twice take highest, and Disadvantage Roll 3D6 twice take the lowest. They also have Courage Points they can spend.
> Combat is meant to be cinematic in style with a tactical flavor. Characters have Physical Health.

## Chapter 1: Character Creation 
{{Write a Definition}}

### Attributes

There are eight attributes and two special attributes.

---

**Physical Attributes**

---


**Body**

Body represents stamina, resilience, and overall health. It measures how much punishment a body can take, resist toxins or disease, and endure physical strain.

**Agility**

Agility reflects agility, coordination, and precision of movement. It governs tasks requiring balance, hand-eye coordination, and finesse, as well as many ranged attacks.

**Reaction**

**Strength**

Strength measures raw physical power, force, and muscular endurance. It determines how much a character can lift, carry, or smash through and is central to melee combat.

---

***Mental Attributes**

**Charisma**

Charisma measures presence, charm, and force of personality. It governs social influence, persuasion, leadership, and the ability to inspire or deceive.

**Intuition**



**Logic**

Logic represents memory, Intelligence, and reasoning ability. It governs problem-solving, technical skills, analysis, and mastery of knowledge.


**Willpower**

Willpower reflects perception, intuition, and awareness of the world. It governs insight into others, survival instincts, and attentiveness to surroundings.

---

**Special Attributes**

**Magic**

Magic reflects a character’s connection to arcane, divine, or supernatural forces. It governs spellcasting capacity, magical resistance, and interactions with the metaphysical.


**Courage**

Courage measures inner resolve, heroism, and the ability to defy fear or hopeless odds. It is both an attribute and a resource, spent or burned to fuel extraordinary feats.


---


### Priority System

In Sixfinity character generation is based on the Priority System. The Priority System is a table with the following columns: Species, Attributes, Magic, Skills, and Resources. The rows are divided into Priority Levels ranging from Priority A to Priority E. Players assign a specific Priority Level for each of the columns to their character depending on their preferences. The values assigned must be different for each column (representing each aspect of the character), and there can be no duplications. For example, a character may not have Priority Level B for Magic and Priority B for Resources. The higher the Priority Level (A, B, etc.), the more valuable it is for the character. Characters use Experience later on to customize their characters even further.

The player begins the character-creation process by choosing their character’s metatype, or species. There are five distinct races within the core Sixfinity system, gamemasters are welcome to add or replace them: dwarfs, elves, humans, orcs, and fomori. Each species receives different racial advantages (and possibly disadvantages). Humans, for example, receive a higher rating in Courage (+1). Formions receive Thermographic Vision, +1 Reach (1 square), and Dermal Armor, but they also have the disadvantage of having their Lifestyle costs doubled to reflect the costs of adapting everything they use—especially their gear, to meet their massive physical requirements. Several species also receive physical or mental advantages/disadvantages to their attribute ratings (such as higher or lower natural attribute limits). When determining which metatype best fits the character concept they wish to play, the player should refer to the Species Attribute Table (below) and review the specific details for each metatype.

Once the player has selected the metatype they wish to play, they should review the Species column to determine which Priority Levels give them the best options for their character based on their preferred metatype and the special attribute points they need. The special attributes are Courage, and Magic; if you want your character to have a high rating in one or more of these areas, make sure you select a row with plenty of special attribute points.

Regardless of Priority all starting characters get 25 Experience to spend on their character to flesh them out, make then unique.

**Priority System Table**

Final Touches and Derived Stats.

### Derived Stats

#### Defense

Defense = REACTION + INTUITION

Roll 3D6 and add Defense for a Defense roll. Roll for Effect.

#### Physical Health

Physical Health = ([Body / 2] + 8) x3

This is your Physical Health. If it reach zero you are bleeding to death. You will start at 0 and lose 1 point per round you are not stabalized. You can go into the negative equal to your Body. 

For Example Jared is hit by a Shotgun for 13. Jared only had 10 Physical left. So Jared drops to 0 and is Incapacitated. The next round Jared drops to -1, Jared has a Body of 5 so he can bleed until he is at -5 once he ticks to -6 he is dead. 

#### Stun Health

Stun Health = ([Willpower / 2] + 8) x3

This is where Stun Damage is recorded. If it reaches 0 you start taking Physical Damage. 

#### Lifeblood

This is how far into the Negatives you can go before you die. 

Lifeblood = Body + Misc Bonuses

#### Toughness

Toughness = [Body + Augmentation Adjustments / 3] Round Up 

This is how much damage you can naturally ignore. It does not apply to Penetrating damage. 

Example: Sarah is fighting a Security Guard. 

The Security Guard fires and gets an Effect of 4. 

Sarah defends rolling her Defenese and gets 1 Effect. The Security Guard has 3 Net Effect that will carry over as Damage. He is firing a Ruger Super Warhawk, with an Accuracy of 5, 9P Damage, and -2 AP.

Sarah is wearing an Armored Jacket with has an 10 Armor Rating. 

Damage Value = (9P + 3 Net Effect) - (10 Adjusted Armor Rating - (-2) AP). This leaves 4 Points 

Sarah has a Toughness of 3. Normally she would take 1 point of Physical Damage. but the -2 AP applies to Toughness as it does not stop Penetrating Damage. So Sarah takes 3 Phiscal Damage. The Armor protected her, but the power of the Ruger punched a little damage through.

Damage Taken = Damage Value - (3 Toughness -  (-2) AP)

#### Movement

Base movement for any character is 10 Yards.

#### Initiative

This is used for Initiative it is also used for Passive checks. Initiative is pre-determined to speed up combat

Initiative = Reaction + Intuition + 1D6

#### Courage Points

List your Courage Rating after character creation.

#### Limits
Limits are your Effect limits. No matter how well you roll (the Rule of Six can get insane). There are limits to the body, those limits will limit how much Effect you can apply to situations. Often times you will be more limited by your equipment than your body. Accuracy on a weapon for example, is a limit to how much Effect you can apply as extra damage.

##### Mental

[(Logic x 2) + Intuition + Willpower] / 3 (round up)

For example if you have a Logic of 5, a Intuition of 3 and a Willpower of 4 your Mental Limit would be 6.

[(5 x 2) + 3 + 4] / 3 = 5.667, rounds up to 6.

##### Physical

[(Strength x 2) + Body + Reaction] / 3 (round up)

##### Social

[(Charisma x 2) + Willpower + Essence] / 3 (round up)

### Character Advancement

In this game you spend your experience you gain at the end of the sessions to increase your charatcer during downtimes. 

Raising attributes is based on what the modifier not the base score. So to increase your Strength that is +3 to +4

| Desired Effect                                  | XP Cost         |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Raise a Physical/Mental/Magic/Courage attribute | Next rating X 5 |
| Raise an active skill                           | New Rating X 2  |
| Raise a Knowledge/Language Skill                | New Rating      |
| New Knowledge/Language Skill                    | 2               |
| New Specialization                              | 2               |
| New Active Skill                                | 4               |
| Additional Physical Health (BOD+STR)            | 10              |
| Buy or upgrade and Edge                         | XP Cost X 2     |
| Remove a Flaw                                   | XP Bonus X 2    |
| New Spell                                       | 5               |

Toughness and Defense, Physical Health, Reactions get recalculated when base attributes go up. You can increase the Misc. bonus to reactions with Experience. There is no option to increase Toughness or Defense characters can buy Armor and have other means to make themselves harder to hit. 



## Chapter 2: Species

Each Species template here is provided as an example. Species in Sixfinity unlike many other games do not start with higher base attributes; instead they just have a higher potential attribute maximum. However, the Gamemaster can also raise their starting attributes by the same amount it is adjusted at the other end if they wish to do so. Not all of these species are used in Sixfinity and none of them are required except humans.

**Reading Species Blocks**

A Species block contains the following information:
- Name
- Description
- Ability Adjustments
- Extra Features like Night Vision

### Humans
Us.

**Ability Adjustments**
- The Human Spirit: +1 Courage
- All attributes limit is 6

### Elf
Pointed ears. Tolkien looking Elves.

**Ability Adjustments**
- Racial Abilities: Low light Vision
- Agility Maximum is 7, Presnce Maximum is 8

### Dwarf
Short, dour, Tolkien looking Dwarfs.

**Ability Adjustments**
- Racial Abilites: Thermographic Vision, Resistance to Poison 
- Body Maximum is 8, Strength Maximum is 8, Charisma Maximum is 5, Movement is 8 yards instead of 10.

### Orc
Fantasy style Orc.

**Ability Adjustments**
- Racial Abilites: Low Light Vision
- Body Maximum is 9, Strength Maximum is 8, Intelelct Maximum is 5, Charisma Maximum is 5

### Troll
Fantasy Troll.

Troll are most commonly found in the British Isles, with notable populations in Wales, Iceland and Southeast Britain. Studies suggest a possible genetic tie between Fomorian expression and Celtic ancestry, hinting that their presence may stem from migration rather than true regional nativity.

Averaging 7 feet and 500 pounds.


**Ability Adjustments**
- Racial Abilites: Thermographic Vision
- Toughness: +1 from Natural Armor
- Body Maximum is 8, Agility Maximum is 5, Strength Maximum is 8, Charisma Maximum is 4



## Chapter 3: Contacts & Allies



## Chapter 4: Rules

The rules center around rolling three six sided dice. One of those dice **must** be of a different color this dice is called the "The Effect Dice" this dice will add drama, excitement, and moments of unpredictability in the game. 

### How does it work?

Nearly everything is a TEST or CHECK. 

Result = 3D6 + Ability Modifier + Skill Rank

So what do we compare them to? Well your total is calculated as Effect (this is why the Effect Dice). Instead of Target Numbers you have a Threshold for things. Threshold is how much Effect you need to succeed at something. Its numeriaclly the same but for Gamemasters which already have a ton to do its a LOT less math. 

#### Rolling 18

If you roll 6 on all three dice ... nothing special happens. Sorry. **EXCEPT** your Effect dice was a 6. The Rule of Six will come into play with that (below)

#### Glitching

Also called a Botch. 

Remember how the Effect Dice is so amazing it has a Rule of Six? Well the good dice giveth, and the good dice taketh away. If you should have the misfortune of rolling a 1 on the Effect dice nothing terribly bad happens, this is called a Glitch. It just means that you lose an Effect as long as you are still over the Threshold you still succeed. Sometimes things just go wrong.

And then ... sometimes things go **very** wrong. Should you have the .48% misfortune of rolling a 1 on all three dice. Well in that case roll the Effect Dice again, if it comes up a 1, roll again, if it comes up a 1 roll again. You see where this is likely going. For each 1 on the Effect Dice you lose 1 Effect. This is called a **critical glitch** sometimes bad things happen to good people.  


### The Rule of Six

This is likely the **most** important rule in Sixfinity. This game is based around rolling 3D6. It has been indicated that one of your D6 should be a different color, called the Effect Dice, in the above rules for "The Rule of Six". The Rule of Six says anytime you roll a 6 (on the Effect Dice), you get to roll it again and add it to the total, if you roll 6 again you can add it and roll again. You can keep rolling as long as you roll 6 and add them to the total. This will tie into Effect, below. 

For example if Sarah rolls 3D6 +7 to attack a security guard and rolls, a 2, 2, and 6 on her Effect Dice, for a total of 10. Sarah re-rolls the Effect Dice and gets 6 again making her total 16, she rolls the 6 again and gets 6 again giving her a 22, she rolls 6 again and gets a 4 adding it to her roll she finishes with a 26. We would call that an Effect of 5.

### Effect

This is where the game really takes off. The higher the player rolls the more Effective they are, the more Effect the get. 

This Effect Scale Chart below is a great reference for looking up what is required to get a certain number of Effect. But you just divide their roll by 6 (or if you want it to be harder or easier you can change it) the default is 6. It will be exceedingly rare to get above an Effect of 6 but it can happen. 

> Why is the default 6? Well I could day ... 3D6 average is 10.5 we usually round that up to 11. 11/2 is 5.5, round that up its 6. This has to do with the Skill Ratings. Or I could say the system is called Sixfinity ... so you know its in the name.

Now 99% of the time the Threshold is going to be 1 or 2, most often it will be 2. 

**Effect Scale Chart**

| Effect -> | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  | 11  | 12  |
| --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Roll      | 6   | 12  | 18  | 24  | 30  | 36  | 42  | 48  | 54  | 60  | 66  | 72  |

> If I am feeling lazy I will just divide their roll by 5 in my head. Then subtract 1 off the Effect its pretty close typically. Why do I use 6 and not 5? Because I did a *ton* of math when I was working on this system and it was closest to the probability I was going for. Use 5 if you want, its your game I use 6. 
>

**Threshold Chart**
| Difficulty  | Threshold |
| ----------- | --------- |
| Easy        | 1         |
| Standard    | 2         |
| Challenging | 3         |
| Hard        | 4         |
| Very Hard   | 5-6       |
| Extreme     | 7+        |



### Advantage and Disadvantage

Advantage means you get an automatic Effect of 1.

Disadvanatage means you are penalized by 1 Effect.


### Success Tests
A Success test means you are counting on the Effect of the test versus {Threshold} or as an Opposed Test (below). The Effect will tell you how well the test did.

Example Sarah rolls with Modifiers a 13. Her Effect is 2, the Threshold is also 2 so she succeeded. 

### Opposed Tests
An Opposed Test is where what you are rolling does not have a direct {Threshold} instead the opponents makes a specified Opposed Roll and whoever has the most Effect wins. Often time the "Net Effect" the amount of Effect 

### Extended Tests

An Extended test has 3 Components: 

1. Target Number Required
2. Number of Successful Attempts
3. Time Interval Per Test

Often written like this: Perform a Mechanics (15,5,1 day) Extended Test. This means the character must succeed at a Mechanics Test VS {Threshold} 15, they must do this 5 times, each attempt takes 1 day fail or succeed. 

### Attribute Only Tests

The gamemaster decides when an attribute-only test is called for and what attributes to apply. Attribute-only tests pair two attributes together to form a modifier, although there may be some situations where only one attribute applies. Here are a few attribute-only pairings built to suit situations where no skill suffices.

**COMPOSURE (CHA + WIL)**

Some situations are tough to deal with, even for hardened runners. When a character is faced with an emotionally overwhelming situation there are only two choices. Stay and fight or turn into a quivering lump of goo. To find out which one happens, make a `Willpower + Charisma` Test. Take note that repeating similar situations over and again eventually eliminates the need to perform this test. Staring down a group of well-armed foes will be scary at first, but after a character does it a few times the fear gives way to instinct.

**JUDGE INTENTIONS (CHA + INT)**

Reading another person is also a matter of instinct. A character can use their instincts to guess at the intentions of another person or to gauge how much they can trust someone. Make an Opposed `Intuition + Charisma` Test against the target’s `Willpower + Charisma`. This is not an exact science. A successful test doesn’t mean the target will never betray you (intentions have been known to change), and deceptive characters can gain another’s confidence easily. This primarily serves as a benchmark or gut instinct about how much you can trust the person you are dealing with.

**LIFTING/CARRYING (BOD + STR)**

The baseline for lifting weight is 30 pounds per point of Strength. Anything more than that requires a `Strength + Body Test`. Each Effect increases the max weight lifted by 30 pounds. Lifting weight above your head, as with a clean & jerk, is more difficult. The baseline for lifting weight above the head is 10 pounds per point Strength. Each Effect on the Lifting Test increases the maximum weight you can lift by 10 pounds. Carrying weight is significantly different than lifting weight. Characters can carry Strength x 20 pounds in gear without effort. Additional weight requires a Lifting Test. Each Effect increases the maximum by 20 pounds. For more details on carrying gear, see Carrying Gear.

**MEMORY (LOG + WIL)**

While there are numerous mnemonic devices designed for remembering information, memory is not a skill. If a character needs to recall information make a `Logic + Willpower` Test.

Glitches can have a devastating effect on memory. A glitch means the character misremembers some portion of the information, such as order of numbers in a passcode. A critical glitch means the character has completely fooled himself into believing and thus remembering something that never actually happened.

### Courage Points

Courage is a character’s luck, the favor of the gods, that unexplainable factor that allows her to beat the odds. A character’s Courage attribute represents the number of Courage points a character has to spend during gameplay. Courage points can be used for a wide range of benfits, each noted below. Courage points that are spent are temporarily unavailable (see Regaining Courage, below)—luck will only take you so far. Note that a character’s Courage attribute never actually changes, even when Courage points are spent, unless the character permanently burns Courage (see Burning Courage)

Humans can have 7 **maximum** courage, other species the **maximum** is 6 without the Lucky Edge. 

Spent Courage refreshes every game session. Or whenever the GM says it does.

On a long rest you get 1 Courage back.

**Optional Rule:** You can refresh a point of Courage on a Critical Success as long as no Courage was spent on that test.

Burnt Courage is gone. You have to buy more with Experience.

#### Spending Courage 

A character can only spend Courage points on her own actions; she cannot spend it on behalf of others (except when engaged in a “teamwork” test). You can only use Courage once on any test/roll or challenge. If you spent a point of Courage for extra dice and rolled a critical glitch anyway, for example, you cannot use Courage to negate that critical glitch since you have already applied Courage to that test.

Spending Courage can do the following, players choice:

- Push the Limit: Re-roll your Effect Die and add the new result to your Effect total. The Rule of Six applies.
- Blitz: Roll the maximum of five Initiative Dice for a single Combat Turn. A character cannot both Blitz and Seize the Initiative in the same combat turn.
- Seize the Initiative: Jump to the top of the initiative order. A character cannot both Blitz and Seize the Initiative in the same combat turn.
- Dead Man’s Trigger: When reduced to 0 Physical Health or about to die, you immediately regain half your Physical Health. This can only be used once per Breather or Long Rest (5 minutes / 6 hours).
- Close Call: Either negate the effects of one glitch or turn a critical glitch into a glitch.



#### Burning Courage

In certain drastic situations, even spending Courage may not be enough. A character can choose to burn a point of Courage permanently reducing his Courage attribute by 1 for one of the following effects:

- Crits and Things: Burn Courage to automatically succeed on any test with exactly 4 net Effect. This ignores Limits, but you must be capable of attempting the action (e.g., you cannot repair a car without a Mechanics skill).
- Not Dead Yet: When facing death you somehow survive. You still take all the negative effects of what happened such as lost limbs, you are just not dead. You are not dying either, you are stable.


## Chapter 5: Edges & Flaws

### Edges
These provide bonuses in role playing situations, situational modifiers, and permanent effects. 


#### Ambidextrous

Cost: 4 XP

The character can use and handle objects equally well with both hands. The character does not suffer disadvantage for using an off-hand weapon. When using two weapons at once, however, the character must still get disadvantage on the off hand attack. 

#### Analytical Mind

Cost: 5

Analytical Mind describes the uncanny ability to logically analyze information, deduce solutions to problems, or separate vital information from distractions and noise. It’s useful in cracking cyphers, solving puzzles, figuring out traps, and sifting through data. This quality gives the character a Advantage to any Mental Tests involving pattern recognition, evidence analysis, clue hunting, or solving puzzles. This quality also reduces the time it takes the character to solve a problem by half.

#### Animal Empathy

Cost: 5 XP

A character with Animal Empathy has an intuitive sense for understanding and handling animals of all kinds.

Effect: You gain a Advantage on all Tests made to influence, calm, train, guide, or control animals (this includes riding, driving, or directing them).

#### Aptitude

Cost: 14 XP

This quality is how you become even better than the best in the world. The standard limit for skills is 12. Every so often, there is a character who can exceed limitations and be truly exceptional in a particular skill. With this particular quality, the character can have one skill rated at 7 at character creation, and may eventually build that skill up to rating 13. Characters may only take the Aptitude quality once.

#### Astral Chameleon

Cost: 10 XP

With the Astral Chameleon quality, the character’s astral signature blends into the background of astral space and is difficult to detect. All signatures left by the character last only half as long as other astral signatures. Any individuals assensing astral signatures left behind by a character with this quality receive a –2 modifier for the Assensing Test. Only characters with a Magic rating and capable of leaving astral signatures may have this quality.

#### Bilingual 

Cost: 5 XP

A character with this quality reads, writes, and speaks a second language fluently. They can list a second language as a native tongue (see Language Skills). **This quality can only be acquired at character creation**; selecting it gives the character a second free language skill during Step Five: Purchase Active, Knowledge, and Language Skills.

#### Blandness

Cost: 8 XP

This character blends into a crowd; he’s seldom noticed and easily forgotten. He is unremarkable in every aspect of physical appearance. Anyone attempting to describe the character cannot come up with anything more precise than “average height, average build, average hair, etc.” Increase the {Threshold} tier for anyone to recall specific details about the character by 1. This means a Memory Test with a difficulty of Average ({Threshold} 10) becomes a Hard test ({Threshold} 15).

Individuals attempting to shadow or physically locate a character with the Blandness quality in a populated setting receive a –2 modifier on all tests related to their search. The same penalty applies if they’re asking around about the person based on the individual’s physical appearance. If the character acquires any visible tattoos, scars, or other distinguishing features, the bonuses from the Blandness quality go away until the distinctive features are removed from the character’s appearance.

In certain circumstances and specific situations, the gamemaster may determine that Blandness does not apply. For example, a Troll with the Blandness quality still towers head and shoulders over a crowd of humans and so still stands out, no matter how average they dress. The character only regains his bonus by leaving the situation where he stands out.

#### Catlike

Cost: 7 XP

A character with the Catlike quality is gifted with an uncanny elegance, a stealthy gait, and an almost preternatural ability to move without making a sound.

They also claim they land on their feet when dropped, though they tend not to let people test this. This quality adds a Advantage to Sneaking skill tests.

#### Codeslinger

Cost: 10 XP

You are exceptionally skilled at navigating the Net and executing digital intrusions.

Effect: You gain a Advantage on all Tests involving hacking, intrusion, or similar Net-based actions.

Restriction: This Edge may only be taken once.

#### Double Jointed

Cost: 6 XP

Your joints are unusually flexible, allowing you to bend and contort your body into extreme positions.

Effect: You gain a Advantage on all Sleight of Hand Tests when performing escape artist actions, such as slipping out of cuffs, ropes, or other restraints.

GM Discretion: You may also attempt to squeeze into cramped or narrow spaces where a less limber character could not fit.


#### Exceptional Attribute

Cost: 14 XP

Some individuals push beyond the natural limits of their species, embodying rare physical or mental potential.

Effect: Choose one Attribute. Your natural maximum for that Attribute increases by +1 above your species’ normal maximum.

Example: A Human with Exceptional Attribute could raise one Attribute to 7 instead of the usual maximum of 6.

Augmented Maximum: The augmented maximum for that Attribute also increases by +1.

Restriction: This Edge may only be taken once.


#### First Impression

Cost: 11 XP

You have a natural knack for sliding into new places and situations as if you belong there.

Effect: You gain a Advantage on all Social Tests made during your first interaction in a new environment—whether infiltrating a group, meeting contacts in a new city, or joining a fresh team.

Limitation: The bonus only applies during the initial encounter. Subsequent meetings and interactions are unaffected.



#### Focused Concentration

Cost: 4 XP (Maxium 6 Rating)

A magician with the Focused Concentration quality has the discipline to manipulate mana more precisely than otherwise possible. This precision reduces stress to the magician. She is able to sustain one spell form with a force/level equal to her Focused Concentration rating without suffering any penalties. For example, a magician with Focused Concentration rating 3 may sustain a Force 3 Armor spell without taking the negative modifier for sustaining a spell. Sustaining any additional spells incurs the standard –2 modifier per spell sustained to Fatigue checks. This quality may only be taken by magician characters that are able to cast spells.

#### Gearhead

Cost: 11 XP

The Gearhead is who you look for when it’s time to stomp on the gas and move. She’s a natural-born driver or pilot. When she’s at the wheel/stick/controls of a vehicle or drone, she has an intuitive understanding of its limitations and its capabilities and is able to coax whatever machine she’s controlling to perform at its best. During vehicle or chase combat, a Gearhead can increase the Speed of her vehicle or drone by 20 percent or increase the Handling modifier by +1 (player’s choice). She also receives a Advantage when attempting difficult maneuvers or stunts in the vehicle. This bonus lasts for 1D6 minutes.

The player can choose to make this bonus last up to an additional 1D6 minutes if she wants. Doing so pushes the vehicle or drone well beyond its design limits and risks catastrophic damage. For each minute the character pushes the vehicle past its initial bonus period, the vehicle automatically takes one point of stress damage (unresisted)

#### Guts

Cost: 10 XP

When a bug spirit with dripping mandibles comes calling, the character with Guts is the one most likely to stand and fight instead of freaking the hell out. Guts gives a character a Advantage on tests to resist fear and intimidation, including magically induced fear from spells or critter powers.

#### High Pain Tolerance

Cost: 7 XP per rating (max rating 3)

Your Lifeblood is increased by 1 per rating.

Restriction: Maximum rating is 3.

#### Human Looking

Cost: 5 XP

Some non-humans can pass for human in most day-to-day situations. Their appearance, mannerisms, and presence blend well enough that most people simply assume they are baseline human.

Effect: Human NPCs treat you with a neutral baseline attitude when making Social Tests, unless given a reason to react otherwise.

Complications: You may suffer increased hostility from non-human NPCs who resent humans—or who think you’re “trying too hard” to look like one.

Restriction: Only Elves, Dwarves, and Orcs may take this Edge.

#### Indomitable

Cost: 8 XP Per rating (Max 3)

Bodies and minds have limits, but some people have the will to push right through those boundaries. For each level of Indomitable, a character receives a +1 increase to an Inherent limit of his choice (Mental, Physical, or Social). He can take up to three levels and can apply them in any way he chooses (+3 to one Inherent Limit, for example; or +2 to one Inherent and +1 to another; or +1 to all three).


#### Lucky

Cost: 12 XP

Some individuals have an indomitable spirit that pushes beyond the limits of their species.

Effect: Your Courage Attribute maximum increases by +1 above your species’ normal limit.

Example: A Human with Exceptional Courage could raise Courage to 8 instead of the usual maximum of 7.

Advancement: This Edge does not grant an immediate increase to Courage; it only raises the cap. The Experience cost for raising the Attribute must still be paid through normal advancement.

Restriction: This Edge may only be taken once.


#### Magic Resistance

Cost: 6 XP per rating (max rating 4)

You have an innate resistance to magical effects, making it harder for spells to take hold—whether harmful or helpful.

Effect: For every 6 XP spent, you gain a +1 bonus on all Spell Resistance Tests. A magically resistant character cannot choose
to lower his magical resistance; it affects all spells and magical effects, good or bad. A character with Magic Resistance is never a willing subject for spells that require a voluntary subject; such spells automatically fail when used on magic resistant characters.

Limitation: This resistance applies to all spells, even beneficial ones such as Heal.

Scaling: This Quality may be taken multiple times, increasing your modifier by +1 for each purchase (up to the maximum of 4).

#### Natural Athlete

Cost: 7 XP

A character with this quality has an innate combination of physical fitness, spatial awareness, and natural athletic or gymnastic talent. While the character may not be a world-class athlete and may require training to achieve peak performance, he is in prime physical shape for his size and weight class. The Natural Athlete adds a Advantage for Running and Gymnastics skill tests.

#### Natural Immunity

Cost: 4 XP or 10 XP

You have an innate or developed resistance to a specific toxin or disease.

Effect:

4 XP: You are completely immune to one natural disease or toxin.

10 XP: You are completely immune to one synthetic (artificially engineered) disease or toxin.

Limitations:

This Quality does not apply to magically based diseases or toxins (such as lycanthropy).

The chosen disease, drug, or poison must be something your character could reasonably have been exposed to. The player and GM must agree on the specific agent.

Exposure: You may safely ingest or be exposed to one dose every (12 – Body) hours with no ill effects. If more than one dose is taken during that period, you suffer normal damage but your recovery time is halved.

Contagion: Immunity does not make you non-contagious. Characters immune to a disease can still carry and transmit it to others, even without symptoms.


#### Photographic Memory

Cost: 6 XP

A character with Photographic Memory can instantly recall facts, dates, numbers, or anything else he has seen or heard. The character gains a Advantage to all Memory Tests



#### Quick Healer

Cost: 3 XP

A Quick Healer recovers from damage more quickly than other characters. The character receives a Advantage to all Healing Tests made on/for/by him, including magical healing.


#### Resistance to Damage

Cost: 8 XP

A character with resistance chooses a *special* type of damage (not Impact or Ballistic) such as Fire, or Poison and gains resistance to that damage. Suffering half-damage from that source. This can only be taken once. 

#### Vigor

Cost: 9 XP per rating (Max 3)

Each time this is taken you increase your Toughness by 1 up to a Max of 3

#### Will To Live

Cost: 5 XP per rating (max 3)

This character can go into the negatives an additional point per rating up to the maximum of 3 when dying. Normally a character can only go into the negative equal to their Body.


---


### Flaws

Flaws provide bonus XP that can be used toward the cost of attributes, skills, edges, and other resources and abilities. Characters may not earn more than 35 XP from purchasing Flaws.

#### Addiction

Bonus: 4 to 25 XP

A character with the Addiction flaw is addicted to alcohol, drugs, or a similar substance with a detrimental effect on the character’s health (note that nicotine, caffeine, and sugar do not count). The value of this flaw depends on how severe the addiction is: Mild, Moderate, Severe, or Burnout. 

Mild (4 XP): the addiction is omnipresent but not blatant or intrusive; it may not even be recognized or acknowledged. At this stage it is easier to seek help, but very few recognize their addiction as something needing help at this stage. Addicts experience cravings at least once a week (if not every few days), but can ignore them if necessary without too much difficulty. The addict suffers a –2 modifier to Willpower and/or Stamina Tests to resist the craving.

Moderate (9 XP): the addiction at this stage is marked and  difficult to overcome. Addicts experience cravings at least once a day (if not more), and they are more difficult to ignore. The addict suffers a –4 modifier to Willpower and/or Stamina Tests to resist the craving.

Severe (20 XP): the addiction is out of control. The addict experiences constant cravings (at least twice a day), suffering a –6 modifier to Willpower and/or Stamina Tests to keep from giving in.

Burnout (25 XP): this is the same as a Severe addiction, except the addict has been in this state for some time and is experiencing the tell-tale signs of habitual use on his body. The character is always under the Exhausted condition. If the character does not kick the habit soon, he will continue to suffer advancing Fatigue at a rate determined by the gamemaster until he dies

#### Allergy

Bonus: Below

| Condition | Value in XP | Description                                                                                                 |
| --------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Uncommon  | 2           | The substance or condition is rare for the local environment. Example Silver,Gold                           |
| Common    | 7           | The substance or condition is common for the local environment. Examples Sunlight, plastic.                 |
| Mild      | 3           | Symptoms are discomforting and distracting.  –2 modifier to all tests made while experiencing the symptoms. |
| Moderate  | 8           | Contact with the allergen produces intense pain. –4 to all tests made while experiencing the symptoms       |
| Severe    | 13          | As Moderate but Vulnerable to weapons that do this damage                                                   |

A character with the Allergy flaw is allergic to a substance or condition. The value of this flaw depends on two factors. 

First, determine whether the substance or condition is Uncommon (2 XP) or Common (7 XP). then determine the severity of the symptoms: Mild (3 XP), Moderate (8 XP), or Severe (13 XP). Add the appropriate point values to find the final value. For example, the value of an Uncommon Moderate Allergy is 10 (2 + 8) points. The Allergy Table above gives descriptions of conditions and severity.

#### Astral Beacon

Bonus: 10 XP

The astral signature of a character with the Astral Beacon quality is like, well, a beacon—highly visible on the astral plane. The signature also lasts twice as long as it would without the Astral Beacon quality and others assensing it receive advantage to their Assensing Test for gathering information about it. Only characters with a Magic rating may take this quality.

#### Bad Luck

Bonus: 12 XP

This character is cursed—his own luck often turns against him. Whenever this character uses Courage, roll 1D6. On a result of 1, the Courage is spent, but it has the exact opposite effect intended. For example, if a character hopes to gain a reroll dice to take the higher option, instead he takes the lower option. If a character spends Courage to go first in an Initiative, he ends up going last. If a character spent Courage to negate a glitch, Bad Luck turns it into a critical glitch.

#### Codeblock

Bonus: 10 XP

The character is hopeless at actions with computers. Anytime they interact with the Net or a computer they get a Disadvantage to their rolls. 

#### Combat paralysis

Bonus: 12 XP

A character with Combat Paralysis freezes in combat situations. On the character’s first Initiative Test in combat, the character
rolls Initiative with disadvantage. On the second and subsequent Initiative Tests, however, the character rolls his normal Initiative. The character also receives a –3 modifier on Surprise Tests.

#### Gremlins

Bonus: 4 XP per rating (max rating 4)

Characters with the Gremlins flaw never seem to get along with technology. Devices malfunction inexplicably in the character’s hands, software constantly crashes whenever he uses it, components become unusually fragile at his touch, and wireless links suffer faltering connections and odd interference.

For every 4 XP gained in this flaw, increase the number of rolled 1s required to get a glitch (normally 3) by 1 whenever the character is attempting to use a moderately sophisticated device (late 20th century technology or later). 

For example, a character with a Gremlins Rating 2 (10 XP) would trigger a glitch if five or more 1s result from a test. The gamemaster may also require the character to make a test for operations that would otherwise succeed automatically, simply to see whether or not a glitch occurs.

When describing the effects of a Gremlin-induced glitch, gamemasters should play up the notion of a particularly weird mechanical or electronic malfunction. For example, if a Gremlin-plagued character glitches while shooting a pistol, the clip might inexplicably fall out of the gun, or the slide might jump off the rails and go flying into the distance. 

Note that Gremlins is a Negative quality—its effects should be hindering to the character (and entertaining to others). Gremlins should not be used as an “offensive ability,” where a character causes his opponent’s high-tech toys to fall apart merely by touching them.

Consider Gremlins to be a curse on the character—if he wants the technology to fail, then it should be more likely not to. this effect only applies to external equipment.

#### Incompetent

Bonus: 5 XP

A character who is Incompetent possesses a total lack of knowledge or ability with a certain Active skill. If this quality is taken, the player must specify an Active skill in which the character is Incompetent. Incompetent may not be applied to Language or Knowledge skills.

The character is treated as having a skill level of “unaware” for that particular skill. In some cases, a Success Test may be required to perform certain tasks that most people take for granted. Characters may not possess that skill, nor may they default on it. Gamemasters are free to reject any choices that would prove irrelevant or exploitative in actual play.

Incompetent may be purchased more than once, choosing a separate skill each time.

#### Loss of Confidence

Bonus: 10 XP

The Loss of Confidence quality means something has caused the character to lose confidence in himself and one of his abilities. Though a skilled hacker, he failed to hack into a Starbucks host, or despite high Agility, he glitched an easy Climbing Test and fell into a dumpster— whatever the reason, he now doubts himself and his abilities. In tests involving the affected skill, the character suffers a –2 modifier. If the character has a specialization with the skill, the character cannot use that specialization while suffering a loss of confidence.

The skill chosen for the character to have a Loss of Confidence must be one that the character prides himself in and has invested in building. Only skills with a rating 4 or higher may suffer the Loss of Confidence quality. Courage may not be used for tests involving this skill when the character is suffering Loss of Confidence.

#### Low Pain Threshold

Bonus: 9 XP

Your Lifeblood is reduced by 1 (minimum 0).



#### Uncouth

Bonus: 14 XP

Uncouth characters are antisocial or sociopathic and have a difficult time interacting with others. The cost for learning or improving Social skills is twice normal for Uncouth characters (including at character creation), and they may never take Aptitude in a Social skill.

Additionally, Uncouth characters are treated as “unaware” in any Social skills that they do not possess at Rating 1 or higher. The gamemaster may require the character to make Success Tests for social situations that normal people would have no problems with.

#### Uneducated

Bonus: 8 XP

An Uneducated character has grown up far away from the modern world and is thus
ignorant of modern society in general, possessing only a rudimentary knowledge of reading,
writing, and arithmetic. this is quality is fitting for characters who grew up in primitive societies or back-to-the-land anti-technological communes (for example, Amazonian primitives, Luddite collectives). This quality also applies to certain sentient creatures that have developed their own primitive society.

Characters with the Uneducated quality are considered “unaware” in Knowledge skills they do not possess, and they may not default on skill tests for those skills. The gamemaster may also require the character to make Success Tests for ordinary tasks that the typical person takes for granted. Additionally, the Experience cost for learning new skills or improving existing ones in these categories is twice normal (including at character creation), and the character may never take Aptitude in one of these skills.

#### Unsteady Hands

Bonus: 7 XP

A character with Unsteady Hands has mild shakes that affect the dexterity and finesse in his hands. The character suffers a –2 modifier for all Agility-based tests when symptoms manifest themselves. The condition could be physiological (an untreated genetic disorder or damaged nerves, for example), caused by psychological trauma, or even be symptomatic of age. Certain augmentations or medications can mask these symptoms under normal circumstances. Under more stressful situations in the course of the run, there is a chance the Unsteady Hands condition can reappear. The character makes an Agility + Body ({Threshold} 20) Test following a stressful encounter (combat, for example). A successful test means the character does not experience the symptoms of this condition (this time). A failed test causes the difficulties associated with unsteady hands to re-emerge, and they remain with the character for the remainder of the run.

#### Tracked (Layered)

Bonus: 5 or 25 XP

There are four levels of tracking. They have a record of some sort making them easily tracked.

- National: At the 5 XP level, the character has what is called Nationally Tacked. They have done something to get on the National Tracking list. The government of the country tracking you keeps loose tabs on your activities. 
- Criminal Record: At the 10 XP level the character has a Criminal Record. At some point in his life, the character was arrested and served time for a felony-level offense and was branded a criminal for the rest of his life. He is legally required to alert authorities of his travel and whereabouts at all times; failure to do so is a felony and can lead to re-incarceration. He is shunned by law-abiding society.
- Corporate Tracked: At the 15 XP level the character works for, worked for, or has had dealings with one of the majoe mega-corporations. This corporation keeps close tabs on you, your travel, transactions etc. Corporations do not have the adhere to privacy laws and can be quite overbearing in their tracking, it will be difficult to ever hide anything from them.
- Corporate Warrant: At the 25 XP level this character is actively wanted by a Megacorporation. They have few limits, near unlimited resources and never forget anything.

#### Vulnerability

Bonus: 10 XP

This character is Vulnerable to a type of special damage (not impact or ballistic) such as Fire or Cold. 

#### Weak Immune System

Bonus: 5 XP or 10 XP

This character is at Disadvantage on certain tests. For 5 XP they are at disadvantage to Stamina tests versus Disease. For 10 XP they are disadvantage on tests versus Poisons and Toxins as well as other hazards like Radiation. 




## Chapter 6: Skills

Base skills are the fundamental skills in Sixfinity. Whereas attributes represent an individual’s inherent capacities, skills are abilities an individual learns over time. Each skill represents the training and methods a character has picked up that enable her to use her natural attributes in a certain way. To reflect this connection, each skill is linked to an attribute. A list of skills and their linked attributes appears in the Skills and Linked Attributes Table, below.

Skills are grouped into two broad categories: Active, and Knowledge. Characters begin the game with a set of skills chosen by the player.

During game play, characters can improve or specialize in skills, or learn new ones as they experience new things. 

**Active Skills**

Active skills are the skills characters use to take action, affect something, or somehow make an impact. These skills are the ones that usually matter the most to characters. Firing a gun, negotiating, driving a car , and so on. For a complete description of base Active skills and specializations see below.

**Knowledge Skills**

Knowledge Skills represent what a character knows about certain subjects. Beginning Knowledge skills are based on a character’s Willpower and Logic attributes. Knowledge skills are useful for fleshing out a character by defining her background or areas of interest, and are used in the game most often to represent legwork, show character development, or allow characters to come up with information they might not otherwise have a chance to gain. they can range from fields of knowledge important in the game universe—such as Corporate Finance, Political History, Research, or Magic—to more esoteric, bizarre, or mundane interests such as trash Metal Bands, or Elven Wines.

Knowledge skills fall into four categories: Academic, Interests, and Professional.

**Languages**
Language is neither an Active nor a Knowledge skill, but a little of both. Language skills should be used only when language may cause a problem in communication, such as when a correct translation or message in a secondary language may be particularly important. It is not necessary to roll dice for Language skills to communicate on an everyday basis. Characters need not make tests to understand each other every time they speak. If a character must interact with someone in another language for an extended period of time, simply make one test to see how well they understand each other during this period, or just benchmark their level of communication based on the skill rating.

Languages have ratings:
| Rating | Meaning                                                                                              |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| -      | Cannot speak or understand                                                                           |
| 1      | Cannot read/write this language, speaking is broken words and slow                                   |
| 2      | Can speak slowly, can read/write basic words and texts at a elementary level                         |
| 3      | Conversational, accented. Can read/write this language without issue, speaking has an obvious accent |
| 4      | Fluent, Accented. Can speak/read/write this language only occasionally making a mistake              |
| 5      | Near native. No accent, can read/write/speak                                                         |
| N      | Native. Can read/write/speak this language without ever rolling                                      |

**Skill Ratings**

Skill ratings are the numerical values assigned to skills or skill groups, either at character creation or when the skill is learned during game play. They represent how good a character is at a task when using that particular skill. Skill ratings are written as the name of the skill, followed by the rating. For example, Sneaking 3 means the character has the Sneaking Skill at a rating of 3. The skill rating is added to the linked attribute to determine the modifier added to 3D6 when that skill is used. For example, if the character with Sneaking 3 also had an Agility 4, she would add 7 to her rolls on a Sneaking Test.

The skill Rating is a numerical value ranging from 1, representing the most rudimentary skill, to 12 (or 13 with the Aptitude quality) representing the height of sentient achievement. 

The unmodified skill rating assigned at character creation or purchased during game play is considered to be the character’s base skill rating. Some abilities and implants (as noted) may increase this rating, creating a modified skill rating. A modified skill cannot exceed the base skill rating x 1.5. Specializations, spells, and other implants may provide a bonus to a skill, but do not change the base skill rating. These extra modifiers are listed in parentheses after the base skill, as in Sneaking 4 (+2)

| Rating | Definition   |
| ------ | ------------ |
| -      | Unaware      |
| 0      | Untrained    |
| 1      | Beginner     |
| 2      | Novice       |
| 3      | Competent    |
| 4      | Proficient   |
| 5      | Skilled      |
| 6      | Professional |
| 7      | Veteran      |
| 8      | Expert       |
| 9      | Exceptional  |
| 10     | Elite        |
| 11     | Legendary    |
| 12     | Apex         |
| 13     | Master       |


### Specializations

If you devote extra time to a subset of a skill, it’s called a specialization. If your character has the Gymnastics skill but spends a lot of time practicing parkour, you get a character that is good at Gymnastics but especially good at climbing past obstacles.

A specialization adds a Advantage to any test made for that skill when the specialization comes into play. You write the specialization in parentheses right after the skill, and then add a “(+2)” after the rating to remind you of the bonus. Characters can have multiple specializations within the same skill, but one applies at a time. 

New characters may only take one specialization per skill at character creation, but you can buy more later. If you want a specialization in a skill, you have to have it first (meaning a Rating of at least 1).

### Defaulting

It is impossible to prepare for every scenario and only slightly harder to have every skill. When you perform an action without actually having the skill for the test, there’s still hope. You can default the skill, making the test using only the attribute to form the modifier. You don’t have any tremendous talent when you default— quite the opposite in fact. Defaulting imposes a –1 modifier in addition to any other modifiers the situation demands. Unless the gamemaster feels that you’re at a complete loss when defaulting, you can use Courage to Push the Limit and better your chances.

Some skills are too technically demanding for you to default. In these cases, you don’t get to even try the test; you just fail. Vehicles or Unarmed Combat, for example, are relatively simple skills that can be attempted without formal training, so you can default if you need to. Mechanics, on the other hand, is too complicated to try without some training (you could say it’s rocket science). Skills that cannot be defaulted are given in italics on the Active Skill List—and it’s also mentioned in the skill description.

## Chapter 7: Equipment

### Shadowrun Economy

{{Put details here}}

### Buying Gear

Gear’s Availability Rating determines how easy (or hard, or practically impossible) it is to acquire a needed or desired piece of equipment. Availability is an abstract amalgamation of factors like rarity, legality, distribution issues, supply, demand, and so on. The letter that follows an item’s numerical Availability Rating shows whether the item is Restricted (R) or Forbidden (F). For this reason, the gamemaster should feel free to modify an item’s Availability Rating—either the numerical value, or its legality code—in situations that would warrant it, like if the strider is in a war zone or in a country with a restricted economy.

Standard gear is generally available in most places. In locations where it is not you can roll `3D6 + Streetwise VS Availability` to see if you can find the items. You must roll for Restricted items, and Forbidden Items you will generally need a Contact to get your hands on those. 

#### Standard Gear

Standard items with no Availability rating can be purchased at your local WalMart, Starbucks, or Electronics Store, or perhaps ordered online or picked up from a vending machine. All you have to do is pay the cost listed in the book for the item (with adjustments from the gamemaster if she wants, according to local market fluctuations or other extenuating circumstances she deems appropriate).

While easy to buy, standard goods are eminently traceable. Records of legal purchases are almost always kept, shared, and cross-indexed; whether this datatrail gets stuck to your fake ID or, worse, a real one, it’s a potential liability. Purchasing habits are valuable to marketing companies, so you’ll start seeing AR advertisements tailored to what you buy and what you like. And since Big Brother Commerce is watching, remember that the Net host that knows and remembers your favorite store to buy sneakers at isn’t necessarily as secure as your commlink. Fake IDs can be used to shield yourself from this pervasive data-mining, but as long as you’re on the grid, even fake IDs will accumulate profiles of their own after long-term use. And there’s always the chance someone can find out more about you than you want to let go.

Of course, standard goods can also be purchased on the black market to avoid traceability, but the gamemaster may decide that the latest copy of Miracle Shooter is more expensive with the digital serial numbers filed off and apply a surcharge for your paranoia.

#### Starting Gear

Like it says in character creation, starting characters may not purchase items with a rating greater than 6 or an Availability greater than 12 during character creation. You don’t need to worry about your purchases at character creation going on some kind of permanent record (although there are some qualities you can take that would). Once the game is on, you can beg, borrow, and steal whatever gear you can get your grubby little hands on—at least, you can certainly try.

### Gear Ratings

Every item described in this chapter includes a set of statistics. Every item has a cost along with an Availability Rating, and most non-weapon, non-armor items, except those that simply confer an ability or don’t, have an overall Rating, usually between 1 and 6. Often a gear’s Cost and Availability are functions of its Rating.

**Accuracy**: Refers to a weapon’s overall accuracy. A firearm’s Accuracy acts as the limit for tests involving that weapon, capping the number of Effect that can be achieved on an attack roll using it.

**Ammo**: Refers to the amount of ammunition a ranged weapon can hold, followed by the method of reloading in parentheses: (b) means break action, (c) means detachable external box magazine, or “clip” in modern street parlance, (d) means drum, (ml) means muzzle-loader, (m) means internal magazine, (cy) means cylinder, and (belt) means belt-fed.

**Armor**: Each piece of armor has an Armor value that adds to the wearer’s Damage Resistance (see Armor).

**Armor Penetration**: All weapons have an Armor Penetration value, although in some cases, this value is listed with no value, meaning no AP. The AP value indicates how a weapon interacts with armor (see Armor Penetration). This is the amount of Armor protection that is ignored by the weapon. It had no effect on Toughness, the only things that ignore Toughness are Special Damage types. 

**Availability**: The higher the Availability of an item, the more difficult and costly it is to get it (see Buying Gear). Gear without an Availability rating can be bought at an appropriate local store or ordered online without any trouble. The letter that follows an item’s numerical Availability rating shows whether the item is Restricted (R) or Forbidden (F). Items without a letter in parentheses are considered legal—they aren’t necessarily easy to find, but you won’t ever get arrested for seeking them.

**Blast**: This rating is possessed by grenades, missiles, rockets, and other area-of-effect weapons. Blast is the amount the blast weapon’s damage value is reduced per yard of distance from the explosion’s point of origin (see Blast Effects).

**Capacity**: Some sensor packages and cyberware can be equipped with a range of subsystems. A Capacity value is listed for these, indicating the maximum amount of “slots” worth of accessories the item can hold. If the Capacity is listed in brackets, it’s the cost of that subsystem or accessory, or the number of slots that item takes up. Some cyberware items with a Capacity cost can also be installed as standalone items (taking up Essence) rather than subsystems (taking up Capacity); if both costs are listed, only one applies, depending on whether you installed it in another item or in yourself.

**Concealability Modifier**: This indicates how easy it is to hide a given item, and is applied as a modifier to Perception + Intuition Tests to spot the item (see Concealing Gear).

**Cost**: This is the base price a character must pay to buy the item. If the item is legal, this is the standard price found at stores or online. Note that rare and/or illegal items may cost less or more depending on certain black market variations (see (Il)legality). Cost is also subject to local supply and demand, so the gamemaster should feel free to adjust it accordingly for certain settings.

**Damage Value (DV)**: A weapon’s Damage Value represents the base amount of harm, in points of damage, it causes when it hits a target. Damage Values consist of a number (the the base damage) and a letter indicating the type of damage caused: P for Physical, S for Stun. A parenthetical annotation following the damage type, such as (f) or (e), indicates that the damage is flechette or electrical (see Damage).

**Device Rating**: The Device Rating determines the overall quality and effectiveness of a device, from a stimulant patch to a commlink.

**Essence Cost**: All cyberware and bioware implants have an Essence Cost, representing the reduction of the character’s Essence rating that occurs when the augmentation is implanted.

**Mode**: A firearm’s firing mode indicates the rate of fire it is capable of. Some weapons have more than one mode available, so characters may switch between them (see Firearms). The firing modes are: SS (single-shot), SA (semi-automatic), BF (burst fire), and FA (full auto).

**Mounts**: There are several places where a weapon accessory can be attached to a firearm: underbarrel, barrel, or top-mount. Only one accessory can be attached to a particular mount. Integral accessories (those that come with the weapon) don’t take up mount locations. Hold-outs don’t have mounts. Pistols, machine pistols, and SMGs do not have an underbarrel mount, just top and barrel mounts. All rifles and heavy weapons have all three types of mounts. Projectile weapons can only take accessories designed for them specifically.

**Reach**: Melee weapons may have a Reach rating, the default value is 1. Meaning you can hit any target within 1 yard. This equates to one square on a combat grid, so within 1 square of you. Each rating over extends the reach of the weapon by 1 square.

**Recoil Compensation (RC)**: This lists the amount of recoil compensation a firearm has to offer, reducing the modifiers from a weapon’s recoil (see Recoil). Numbers in parentheses refer to full recoil compensation that applies only when all integral accessories are deployed (folding or detachable stocks and so forth).

> Why isn't range listed? Because its a dumb concept in a TTRPG. I can hit a target with an AR-15 at almost a mile out. Basically if I can see it, its in range. Thats why. I love Gygax as much as the next guy but a Longbow fired by a professional can hit a target at a 100 yards easily which is also within site.

#### Melee Weapon Descriptions

**BLADES**

Use the Blades skill to wield these weapons. Combat axe: A two-handed tungsten-alloy monster, available single- or double-bladed. A hardened thrusting point can be concealed, spring-loaded, in the handle. While it may seem barbaric or primitive, the physical augmentations of 2075 can make an old-school weapon like a combat axe even deadlier than a firearm in the right hands. So go ahead, go medieval.

Combat knife: A long, KA-BAR-style fighting knife with a blacked-out blade and a chisel point for punching through armor.

Forearm snap-blades: These are essentially like spurs, only they’re external—painless to install or remove. A forearm sheath conceals three blades that can be extended or retracted via wireless link or muscle movement commands.

Wireless: Readying the forearm snap blades is a Free Action instead of a Minor Action.

Katana: The legendary two-handed sword of the samurai. The katana has become synonymous not just with street samurai, but with shadowrunners in general, at least in the trids; they’ve got everyone packing a katana, from the decker to the mage. But being a silly cliché doesn’t make this blade any less dangerous, or less helpful in a fight.

Knife: Your basic, all-purpose street cutter. It comes in a bewildering array of styles, colors, and flavors, but the statistics don’t vary from one to the next. Ordinary knives are used by the poor, the desperate, or the cautious as backup weapons.

Pole arm: This is, at its very essence, a blade on the end of a very long stick. It usually features an axe-head, glaive, spear point, or similar maiming implement. It’s not easy to handle and it’s just about impossible to conceal, but it’s popular both with trolls and with melee combatants looking to safely keep said large trolls at more than arm’s length.

Survival knife: A fine quality blade—smooth on one edge, serrated on the other—with several accessories, including a GPS monitor, mini-multitool, micro-lighter, and a hidden compartment in the handle. The sides of the steel are coated with a non-toxic chemical that blacks out the blade when inert to prevent unwanted reflection, but can be activated to provide two hours of phosphorescent light. All knives can cut flesh, but a survival knife is better at cutting rope and wood, or otherwise being used as a tool. The survival knife is the kind of gadget that no professional should be without. Wireless: The knife displays an ARO of local maps, your GPS position, and can be used to make commcalls.

Sword: It’s sharp, it’s heavy, and it will fragging cut you wide open. Available in a wide variety of styles (wakizashi, seax, scimitar, jian, machete, and so on and so forth), this one-handed blade is not as formidable as a katana but is substantially easier to hide.

**CLUBS**

Use the Clubs skill to inflict blunt force trauma with these weapons.

Club: The weapon they named the skill after. These stats represent a range of objects, including an axe handle, baseball bat, wrench, crowbar, a tire iron, and a two-by-four with a rusty nail in it. There is a price listed, but it’s not overly difficult to find one for free if you know where to look.

Extendable baton: This telescoping club can be collapsed, and it can be extended with a sharp flick of the wrist or a wireless signal. When retracted, it’s more easily concealed (Concealability Modifier 0 when retracted, +2 when extended). Wireless: Readying the extendable baton is a Free Action instead of a Minor Action.

Sap: Also called a blackjack, this is a small, springy club, or a flat piece of iron in a flexible leather covering. It’s specially designed for concealment (Concealability Modifier –2).

Staff: This large, heavy stick is popular with magicians going for that traditional look. Available in composite, hardwood, high-carbon steel, and other materials.

Stun baton: A standard riot-control weapon, viewed as a tool and symbol of corporate-government oppressors but pragmatically useful to runners. It has ten charges and regains one charge per ten seconds when plugged in. Wireless: The stun baton recharges by induction, regaining one charge per full hour of wireless-enabled time.

Telescoping staff: This is a metal and composite staff that can telescope down to a reasonable size, one that can be concealed about as easily as a stun baton or a sword. It can be extended and locked in place by whirling it at the correct speed and angle and twisting the grip, or via a wireless signal. Wireless: Readying the telescoping staff is a Free Action instead of a Minor Action.

**BOWS**

Bows: This could be a traditional longbow of fiberglass or wood, or possibly a modern compound-and-pulley bow. Both are archaic and rare weapons on the streets of 2075, and both have the advantage of being hacker- proof. Reloading a bow takes a Minor Action (Ready Weapon).

Bows have ratings that indicate the minimum Strength you need to use that weapon. When attacking with a bow, a character whose Strength is less than the Strength minimum suffers a –3 modifier per point below the minimum; this penalty reflects the difficulty they have in pulling the bow and nocking an arrow. The weapon’s Rating is also used to determine its range and damage (maximum Rating is 10). Use the lowest value of your Strength, the bow’s rating, or the arrow Rating for range and damage when attacking a target, because your average Rating 10 titanium-sheathed beryllium-alloy bow tends to turn wood or fiberglass arrows into powder when they hit a target.

Crossbows: Modern crossbows are equipped with
automatic reloading devices, so unless you’re using
a museum piece, reloading doesn’t require a Ready
Weapon action. Crossbows have internal magazines (m)
holding up to 4 bolts. Crossbows are available in Light,
Medium, and Heavy sizes.

Injection arrow/bolt: An injection bolt causes the same damage as a regular arrow or bolt, but also includes a payload of one dose of a drug or toxin. Effects depend on the drug payload, but to successfully deliver it, the attack must deal at least one box of damage after the Damage Resistance Test. This is an injection vector toxin attack.

Throwing knives/shuriken: A wide variety of shapes and sizes of aerodynamically balanced, specially weighted, muscle-powered throwing weapons are available, from throwing spikes to darts to kunai and shuriken. A character can ready (Agility ÷ 2) of these knives with one Ready Weapon action.

Wireless: If all the throwing knives or shuriken you throw in a single Combat Turn are wireless and you have a smartlink system, each knife you throw receives a +1 bonus per knife thrown that Combat Turn at your current target, as the knives inform and adjust for wind and other atmospheric conditions. So you’d get no bonus on the first throw, a +1 bonus on the second throw, a +2 bonus on the third throw, etc. (assuming you aimed all three knives at the same target).

#### Firearm Descriptions

Cold steel that spits hot lead. Slug-throwing firearms are by far the most common weapons on the streets of 2075. Each weapon is chambered to take either old-fashioned cased ammunition or caseless ammo. Most firearms load caseless ammunition, with fewer and fewer models coming in variants able to handle cased ammunition. Sure, releasing a storm of shell casings when you hold down the trigger looks awesome, but it’s impractical for the modern shadowrunner and their natural enemy, law enforcement and corporate security.

Firearms come with wireless capability and a digital ammunition counter. Ammunition is sold separately. All firearms have the following wireless bonuses in addition to any wireless bonuses on each model: 

**Wireless**: The weapon displays an ARO that tells you ammo levels and ammo type loaded. If you have a DNI, you get two additional benefits. First, ejecting a clip (for weapons that have them) is a Free Action rather than a Minor Action. Second, changing fire modes (on models that have more than one) is a Free Action rather than a Minor Action.

**TASERS**

Tasers are legal to carry and a great choice for non-lethally incapacitating someone. Tasers, like other electrical weapons, have a flat Armor Penetration value of –5 and deal electricity damage. Use the Pistols skill to fire a taser. Tasers can take only top-mounted accessories.

Defiance EX Shocker: This heavy-duty taser fires up to 4 darts that trail wires up to 20 meters long. The wired connection to the battery allows for a more powerful shock. Most modern tasers use wireless darts, so the Defiance EX Shocker is an exception. It also features contacts that allow it to be used as a stun weapon in melee (Accuracy 3, DV 8S(e), Reach 0). Wireless: A successful hit informs you of the status of the target’s basic health (and Condition Monitors).

Yamaha Pulsar: The darts of this taser contain wireless capacitors, meaning that the Pulsar eliminates the need for cumbersome wires. As a trade-off, it is slightly less powerful than the EX Shocker, although it can fire faster. It lacks the EX Shocker’s melee contacts. Wireless: A successful hit informs you of the status of the target’s basic health (and Condition Monitors).

**HOLD-OUTS**

Hold-out pistols are very concealable and are perfect for sneaking into a meet or wearing as a back-up piece. They don’t have much else going for them, being both weak and inaccurate. Use the Pistols skill when firing a hold-out pistol. Hold-outs can’t take accessories. 

Fichetti Tiffani Needler: Designed to appeal to social climbers and debutantes, the Tiffani Needler is available in a wide variety of colors and styles. It also has a special color-changing coating that can be manipulated via wireless signal. This is useful to make sure your gun matches with your shoes or your handbag. The Needler can only fire flechette rounds (already factored into its damage code). Wireless: You can change the color of the Tiffani Needler with a Minor Action. 

Streetline Special: Popular among society’s dregs, the Streetline Special is a small, lightweight weapon made of composite materials. Magnetic Anomaly Detectors suffer a –2 modifier to detect it.

Walther Palm Pistol: This is a classic double-barreled derringer in an over-under barrel combination. It packs a punch for its size, but on the downside it has one of the most diminutive “magazine” capacities on the market— just one bullet per barrel. Both barrels can be fired at once as a short burst.

**LIGHT PISTOLS**

Light pistols are highly accurate and fairly concealable, occupying a comfortable middle ground between Hold-outs and Heavy Pistols. They’re extremely common on the streets. Use the Pistols skill when firing a light pistol. Light pistols can take top- and barrel- mounted accessories.

Ares Light Fire 75: Designed based on one of the most common pistols on the market, the Light Fire is a weapon for special operators, not commonly available through legal channels. A special barrel-mounted silencer developed exclusively for the Light Fire comes attached, applying an additional –1 modifier to the modifier usually provided by silencers. In addition to its integral silencer, the Ares Light Fire 75 includes a smartgun system.

Ares Light Fire 70: The Ares Light Fire 70 is one of the most common pistols on the market. A special barrel-mounted silencer developed exclusively for the Light Fire 70 is available that gives you an additional –1 modifier to the usual –4 (for a total of –5); this silencer costs 750¥.

Beretta 201T: This light sidearm is used by many security professionals. It is capable of burst fire. Since the 201T is classified as a light pistol without further limitations, it is quite popular with security agencies in countries where heavy pistols and machine pistols are hard to come by legally. Semi-automatic bursts using the Beretta 201T require a Minor Action. The weapon includes a detachable shoulder stock.

Colt America L36: A venerable pistol with a great reputation. This basic firearm is cheap, easily concealed, and nearly ubiquitous. A perfect throwaway weapon.

Fichetti Security 600: A light sidearm for security forces, this weapon’s highly efficient feeding mechanism allows it a thirty-round magazine. The Fichetti Security 600 comes with a detachable folding stock and laser sight

Taurus Omni-6: This reliable, rugged revolver is specially designed to handle a wide variety of ammunition. Popular with hobbyists and hand-loaders, the Omni-6 comes with some interchangeable cylinders so it can take either cased or caseless, light pistol or heavy pistol ammo. When firing light pistol rounds, the Omni-6 is semi-automatic (SA) and has a base DV of 6P, and when it fires heavy pistol ammo it has only single shot mode (SS), and a base DV of 7P and –1 AP. The Omni-6 includes an integral laser sight.

**HEAVY PISTOLS**

Heavy pistols are powerful sidearms that are a good compromise between concealability and firepower. When you shoot a heavy pistol, you use the Pistols skill. Heavy pistols can take top- and barrel- mounted accessories

Ares Predator V: The newest iteration of the most popular handgun in the world, especially with mercenaries and shadowrunners. Upgraded with improved ergonomics and handling features, the Ares Predator V includes a smartgun system. Some say that the Ares Predator V isn’t better than other guns in its class, but no one can argue that it has better brand recognition.

Ares Viper Slivergun: The sleek Slivergun pairs the undeniably winning combo of burst-fire capability and built-in sound suppression (an integral silencer) with its large magazine capacity. It fires metal slivers that count as flechette ammunition, which is factored into the weapon’s damage code.

Browning Ultra-Power: This venerable sidearm is the Ares Predator’s primary competition as the world’s toughest heavy pistol. It offers a built-in top-mounted laser sight and is slightly cheaper

Colt Government 2066: This government-issue weapon, styled after the legendary Colt M1911a1, uses an electrically induced spark to detonate the bullet’s propellants. The removal of most moving parts from the firing mechanism gives this weapon a reputation for being exceptionally reliable.

Remington Roomsweeper: This is really more of a short-barreled shotgun than a pistol. When loaded with shot rounds (flechette) rather than solid slugs, it uses Heavy Pistol ranges but shotgun rules

Ruger Super Warhawk: This revolver is as loud as a jet liner and twice as shiny. It’s also one of the scariest handguns in the world. The cased ammo variant is popular for the sheer thrill of swinging open the cylinder gate one handed and dumping spent brass 

**MACHINE PISTOLS**

Machine pistols offer a high rate of fire in a compact package. Use the Automatics skill to fire a machine pistol (characters may use the Pistols skill in Semi-Auto mode). Machine pistols can take top- and barrel-mounted accessories.

Ares Crusader II: A large magazine and easy handling make the Ares Crusader II one of the most popular weapons of its class. It features an integral barrel-mounted gas-vent 2 recoil compensation system and comes with an integral smartgun system.

Ceska Black Scorpion: This classic machine pistol provides concealable burst-fire capability. It comes equipped with an integral folding stock.

Steyr TMP: This lightweight polymer-frame pistol is capable of full autofire, but its light weight makes it hard to control when firing on full auto. It comes equipped with a built-in top-mounted laser sight.

**SUBMACHINE GUNS**

Use the Automatics skill when firing a submachine gun.
SMGs can take top- and barrel-mounted accessories.

Colt Cobra TZ–120: With its unique design and wide range of accessories, the Colt Cobra series is quite popular both among security forces the world over and on the trids. The TZ–120 comes with a folding stock, top-mounted laser sight, and a barrel-mounted gas-vent 2 system.

FN P93 Praetor: This bullpup submachine gun was purpose-built for Corporate Court-controlled Interpol fast-response teams. Its special chamber system provides 1 point of Recoil Compensation, it has an integrated rigid stock, and a flashlight that can be used to reduce darkness penalties by one step (Environmental Modifiers). Possession of the FN P93 while not a legitimate member of a Corporate Court force is a crime in most jurisdictions.

HK–227: The SMG of choice for many corporate and military security forces, the HK–227 boasts a retractable stock, smartgun system, and integral sound suppressor

Ingram Smartgun X: Grade-A bang bang. Famous as the weapon of choice for many legendary street samurai since the 2050s, the Ingram Smartgun comes tricked out with a gas-vent 2 system, a smartgun system, and an integral sound suppressor

SCK Model 100: Shin Chou Kyogo is synonymous
with Japanese corporate security. Nearly every Japanacorp’s
security forces are issued the SCK 100, including
Renraku’s infamous Red Samurai. The SCK 100 features
an internal smartgun system and a folding stock.

Uzi IV: This aging submachine gun is a worthy descendant
of the famous Israeli weapon. The SMG features
an integral folding stock and built-in top-mounted
laser sight.

**ASSAULT RIFLES**

Use the Automatics skill when firing an assault rifle. Assault rifles can take top-, barrel-, and underbarrel- mounted accessories.

AK-97: The AK-97 is a legendary weapon with storied reliability—you can bury it for ten years, dig it up, and fire it immediately without a single problem. When all of the nano-fabricated AK–174s melted to slag, the AK-97s kept functioning just fine.

Ares Alpha: Specially designed for Ares Firewatch special forces, the Alpha has since become a multi-platinum best-selling success the world over, seeing use with UCAS Special Forces. In part, this is due to its exceptional brand awareness, and also because of its underbarrel grenade launcher, smartgun system, and an expensive chamber design that provides 2 points of Recoil Compensation.

Colt M23: This cheap, mass-produced, no-frills assault rifle is loved both by the gangbangers and pirates who can manage to get their hands on one and by the pros who are looking for something to modify from the ground up.

FN HAR: This assault rifle is supremely popular with private security forces and corporate threat-response teams. It features a laser sight and a gas-vent 2 system

Yamaha Raiden: This electronic-firing assault rifle is state-of-the-art. The Raiden is very accurate and is quickly being adopted by japanacorp security forces and the Japanese Imperial Marines. It features an integral sound suppressor and smartgun system, and the electronic firing mechanism and design provides 1 point of Recoil Compensation.






### Vehicles

Vehicles in the modern era form a mundane part of daily life, until it comes time to outrun a pursuer, deliver a priceless artifact at high-speed, or travel through a warzone under bombardment. Vehicle statistics do not enter play during stress-free scenes. When tested, however, players will need to consider their vehicle attributes.

**Vehicle Speed**

Vehicles have various Velocity classes, used to handle their very fast movement when compared to people moving on foot. Velocity also dictates how much damage a vehicle inflicts on a collision or sideswipe ram attack. The velocity classes are as follows.

- Standard: The vehicle moves in the same speed range as humans and animals.
- Fast: Automobiles and boats typically move at this speed, allowing them to safely cruise at 50 to 100 mph, and move faster at the risk of safe handling.
- Very Fast: Specialized cars, helicopters, and other exceptionally fast vehicles capable of stable operation at speeds in the range of 200 mph belong to this class.
- Extreme: Civilian and light military fixed-wing aircraft belong to this category. These routinely operate at speeds of 400 mph or greater.

**Vehicles, Cover & Armor**

Vehicles provide a cover rating of 0 for motorcycles and similar vehicles, 1 for convertibles with the top down, and 2 for hardtop vehicles, even with the windows rolled up (they shatter under fire). Some armored vehicles provide a dedicated Armor Rating, which stacks with Toughness and worn armor. This changes to a cover rating if doors or windows are opened.

**Vehicle Details**

The accompanying table contains game system information
for vehicles, providing the following details:

- Handling: The vehicle’s Handling rating is the modifier applied to tests to maintain control of the vehicle. In vehicular combat, a vehicle’s Defense is 10 + Handling + the attribute associated with its focus.

- Capacity: The vehicle’s passenger capacity. This capacity is adjustable, depending on the brand of vehicle acquired.

- Velocity: As noted earlier, vehicles belong to various Velocity classes. The Standard class applies to humans, horses, and other creatures with normal Speed ratings. Higher Velocity classes belong to faster vehicles. Velocity comes into play during chases and other situations where high speed matters. The Velocity modifier after the slash distinguishes the relative speeds of vehicles within the same class, such as a faster versus a slower automobile.

- Ram: This is the vehicle’s base damage for ram attacks. Ram damage increases when a vehicle is moving especially fast compared to its target.

- Hull: Some vehicles are exceptionally tough. This lists the points that must be spent on the Pierce Hull vehicle stunt before using other Anti-Vehicle Stunts to inflict damage.

- Purchase {Threshold}.: The Resources {Threshold} to acquire equipment. It may vary depending on the location the game is set in, or the quality of vehicle.


| Vehicle               | Handling Difficulty | Capacity | Velocity    | Ram | Hull | Purchase {Threshold} |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | -------- | ----------- | --- | ---- | -------------------- |

- * Vehicle has a Speed rating like a character’s.
- ** Cannot be purchased under ordinary circumstances.


Bicycle: A pedal-powered bike. A bicycle moves at its operator’s speed +5. Any attack that hits a bicycle wrecks it, regardless of damage, and also inflicts damage on the cyclist.

Classic Motorbike: A large touring motorcycle. If the cyclist is injured, they must succeed at a {Threshold} 13 Agility (Driving) test to avoid crashing.

Sports Bike: An agile motorcycle designed for speed over stability. If the cyclist is injured, they must succeed at a {Threshold} 13 Agility (Driving) test to avoid crashing.

Compact Car: A utilitarian vehicle that can seat five people, but uncomfortably. Some models are designed as low-end sports cars. In such cases, add +1 to the car’s Handling and Velocity modifiers, and +1 to the Resources difficulty to purchase it, but drop its capacity by 1 or 2, depending on the model.

Sedan: A large vehicle with plenty of space in the rear cabin, favored by executives and well-to-do families. Its statistics can also be used to represent civilian SUVs and small vans.

Sports Car: A high-end vehicle built for performance. An even higher end class of “supercars” adds +1 to Velocity and the Resources difficulty to purchase. Both types turn heads when they’re seen on the road.

Light Truck: A “box truck” or large van. Its listed capacity is only for the cabin; far more people could easily ride in the back. It can haul two or three tons, though if loaded close to its maximum capacity, its Handling penalty increases

Light Armored Vehicle: A military armored truck designed for toughness and agility. LAV’s are also used by SWAT teams and elite security forces. The enclosed cabin provides an Armor Rating of 6 versus ballistic damage and explosions. This stacks with Toughness and worn armor.

Light Drone: This is a multi-rotor drone of the type that would be used by filmmakers, photographers, and high-end hobbyists. It is capable of recording video and sound, and may be equipped with night vision and additional sensors or given a light, remotely operated weapon (no larger than a handgun) by a less ethical owner. Any collision with or attack on a light drone automatically destroys it, though it might be possible to salvage components such as its camera memory.

Light Helicopter: A small civilian helicopter of the type used to transport executives, or which would be flown for recreation. Direct collisions, along with attacks on the rotor, make a controlled emergency descent impossible. In these situations, a fall from a significant height will almost certainly be lethal—at least in Gritty games.

Light Attack Aircraft: This aircraft isn’t suited to dogfighting, but designed for training, patrols, and ground attack functions. Its fire-linked, twin .50 cal. machine guns each function as fully-automatic versions of the anti-material rifle, but no more than one of them can be brought to bear on a human-sized target. The aircraft may also carry air-to-air missiles and bombs, which the GM should treat as hazards. The pilot can use its weapons with the Activate action.

Light Bulldozer: This tracked vehicle is used to haul material, demolish things, and flatten terrain. It’s slow, moving at a Speed of 15, but crushes or smashes virtually anything in its path.

### Lifestyle

A character’s Resources determines their basic lifestyle, but sometimes a protagonist wants to explore the life of excess. Characters don’t pay for their personal housing, food, or upkeep, as these elements roll into the Resources ability, and run the risk of banality when introduced to play. The lifestyle expansions in this table are the types of activities and purchases a character will need to test with their Resources ability.

Chaff Grenades: When thrown within a 15-yard proximity of electronics, a chaff grenade disrupts the operations of any non-insulated device for 2d6 rounds, using a combination of conductive foil and an electromagnetic pulse.

Flash Grenades: These bombs create a blinding flash affecting anyone within a 15-yard radius, if the person(s) looked in the direction of the explosion. The blindness goes away after 2d6 rounds.

Magnifying Scope: A magnifying scope acts as a modern pair of binoculars, with zoom functions and built-in camera. Scopes are assumed to be included with sniper rifles and anti-materiel rifles. Adding a scope to another firearm increases its maximum range from 1.5x to 2x its listed base range.

Night Vision Goggles: Battery-powered goggles allowing users greater vision in darkness, illuminating anything within the goggles’ range in shades of gray or green hues.

Smoke Grenades: These bombs create a cloud of obscuring gas that expands up to 10 yards from detonation point. The cloud dissipates after 1d6 rounds.

Suppressor: Otherwise known as a silencer, suppressors dull the noise of gunfire. A suppressor makes a firearm almost impossible to hear outside any room it’s fired in, or beyond a 5-yard radius, whichever is smaller

Thermal Goggles: Battery-powered goggles allowing users to see heat and movement in darkness.



## Chapter 8: Combat

### Initiative

Initiative determines the order in which characters act, as well as how often they act during a single Combat Turn. Initiative is based on three factors: Initiative Attribute, Initiative Score, and Initiative Dice.

#### Initiative Attribute

The Initiative Attribute is a derived attribute used to measure the speed, perceptiveness, and reaction rate of a combatant. 

There are multiple types of Initiative. Physical and Astral.

Astral is used for Magicians fighting Astral entities. This is `Intutition X 2`

Physical is the most common and is pre-written on characters. This is `Reaction + Intuition`

#### Initiative Score

To determine a character’s Initiative Score, make an Initiative Test rolling the character’s Initiative Dice and adding the total to your Initiative attribute—this total is your Initiative Score. Courage may be used on this test to roll the maximum of 5D6 for a single Combat Turn. The gamemaster records the score for each character, from highest to lowest. The character with the highest score goes first and the others follow in descending order during each Initiative Pass.

If there is a tied Initiative Score use CRIC (Courage, Reaction, Intuition, Coin toss) to break the tie, comparing Attributes in that order, with the character with the higher Attribute going first. If you’re still tied after comparing all three tie-breaker Attributes, flip a coin. Alternately, at the gamemaster’s discretion, both characters can act simultaneously.

#### Initiative Passes

How many times a character can act during a Combat Turn is determined by the Initiative Test. Every character starts out with a base Initiative die of 1D6. Some characters may spend Courage or have magic or implants that increase their Initiative dice total, allowing them to roll more dice and potentially perform more actions than their non-enhanced associates.

The Combat Turn is divided into Initiative Passes. Everyone gets to act during the first Initiative Pass (in order according to their Initiative Score). At the end of each Initiative Pass the **gamemaster subtracts 10 from all characters Initiative Score**. Characters with an Initiative Score higher than 0 get to go again during a second Initiative Pass. This process is repeated until all characters have an Initiative Score of 0 or less, the Combat Turn ends, or the combat ends.

A character with an Initiative Score of 0 or less can only take one Free Action during an Initiative Pass. However, a character with 0 or less Initiative is allowed one Free Action. She can also respond to attacks by dodging or defending herself.

#### Changing Initiative

In some cases, a character’s Initiative Score or Base Initiative Dice may change in the middle of a Combat Turn. A player might gain Initiative by activating an augmentation, for example, or could receive a boost from a drug or spell or other enhancer. Conversely, a character who is wounded or whose vital equipment (weapon, augmentation, etc.) takes damage might lose Initiative.

If a character’s Initiative attribute changes, immediately apply the difference as a positive or negative modifier to the character’s Initiative Score. This new Initiative Score applies to all remaining actions in that Combat Turn. So a character with Initiative 8 and an Initiative Score of 11 who activates an implant that changes his Initiative to 10 (+2) immediately raises his Initiative Score to 13 (11 + 2).

If the number of Base Initiative Dice available to a character increases, that character immediately rolls the extra Initiative Dice and adds the sum to their current Initiative Score for that Combat Turn. So a magician with 1d6 Initiative dice who takes his first action to astrally project (2d6 Base Initiative Dice) gains the die (and the change in Initiative) for their Astral Initiative during that Combat Turn. (In this case, the magician would also replace their Reaction + Intuition for Physical Initiative with Intuition x 2 for Astral Initiative.)

If the number of Initiative Dice available to a character decreases, then that character immediately rolls the number of lost dice and subtracts the total from their Initiative Score (along with any decrease to their Initiative Attribute). Initiative also changes when a character or NPC is injured. Wound modifiers are applied directly to the character’s Initiative attribute. These changes do not allow the character to act again; they simply change their Initiative score.

If a character enters combat after it has already begun, they should roll for their Initiative Score as normal and then subtract 10 for each Initiative Pass that has already occurred. This means they may get an Action Phase during the current Combat Turn or they may not, but at least they have a chance.

#### Timed Itemd & Initiative

Some items, such as grenades, explosive devices, timed traps, and so on, go off after a certain preset interval. In most situations, these items do what they do based on the character’s current Initiative Score during the next Combat Turn. If there are no more Combat Turns, the item activates as the gamemaster sees fit.

If an item has a timer set by a player character, that character can decide for how long to set the timer, but he must declare this when the item is activated. It’s usually best to have such items go off during the character’s Action Phase on a predetermined Initiative Pass or at the beginning or end of a three-second Combat Turn. Timed items always go last in the case of tied Initiative Scores. In the case of radio-detonated items, the character spends their Action Phase performing a Use Item action.



### Action Economy

Every Initaitive Pass A Character gets:
One Major Action
One Minor Action
One Voluntary Reaction


#### Major Actions
- Charge: You move up to half your Speed (rounded down) in yards and finish with a melee attack against an adjacent enemy. If you moved at least 4 yards in a straight line before reaching your target, you gain advantage on your attack roll.
- Dodge: Using the Dodge action lets a character focus on avoiding being hit in combat. When a character uses the Dodge action, anyone attacking them has disadvantage on their attack rolls, and the character has advantage on Agility saving throws. These effects last until the start of the character’s next turn.
- The Disengage action can be useful when a combatant wants to escape a melee opponent or run past other enemies. If a combatant uses the Disengage action, their movement for the rest of their turn does not provoke opportunity attacks.
- First Aid: By using the First Aid action, a character can make an Logic (First Aid) check to provide first aid to an ally or to themself during combat. Some activities associated with the First Aid action require a first aid kit for essential supplies
- Melee Attack: You attack one adjacent enemy in hand-to-hand combat. An enemy within 2 yards of you is considered adjacent. Unarmed or Armed Combat (Blades, Clubs, etc.) test
- Ranged Attack: You fire or throw a missile weapon at one visible enemy within range. Ranged Combat (Automatics, Pistols, etc.) Test.
- Sprint: On foot, you may move up to Speed in yards, sacrificing the ability to perform another action so you can move farther. You cannot take this action if you are prone
- Help: A character can use the Help action to assist an ally within reach with something they are doing. The ally gains advantage on one ability check or attack roll made before the start of the helping character’s next turn.
- Hide: A character can use the Hide action to attempt to get out of sight, making a Agility (Sneaking) check as part of a contest with combatants that might notice them.
- Object Interaction: The Object Interaction action allows a character to do something with an object that requires focus and concentration, or which goes beyond the limits of what is allowed as a free action
- Reload: The Reload action allows a character to pull ammunition from their inventory, then load their weapon with that ammunition, giving it a full number of rounds. A combatant must have a hand free to use the Reload action. This is required for Major reload weapons but will work for Minor reload weapons. 
- Search: A character uses the Search action to deliberately observe their environment using either a Willpower (Perception) or Logic (Investigation) check.
- Second Wind: When a hero uses the Second Wind action they spend 1 Courage and gain half their Physical Health, they can’t do so again until finishing a breather or long rest. NPCs and companions normally can’t take this action.
- You may also take another Minor Action in place of your Major Action


#### Minor Actions
- Activate: This action allows you to start using certain abilities or items, such as an arcane power or an electronic device. When a vehicle has integrated weaponry (such as a machine gun built into a spy car) you use the Activate action to deliver attacks.
- Aim: You take the measure of your opponent and plan your next strike. If your next action is a Melee Attack or Ranged Attack, you gain advantage on your attack roll.
- Attacking with an Offhand Weapon is a Minor Action and is rolled at Diasadvantage (unless the proper Ambidextrous Edge is obtained)
- Move: You can move up to your Speed in yards and can combine this with actions like falling prone, standing up, mounting a horse, or climbing on a vehicle, but these actions consume half your Speed (rounded down).
- Prepare: When you take this action, you postpone your major action to use at a later point. You declare one major action and your choice to Prepare it. After you do so, the next person in initiative order acts, and so on, but at any time until your next turn, you can interrupt another character and take your prepared action immediately. If you don’t use the prepared action by your next turn, you lose it.
- Ready: You draw a weapon, pull out a device, or otherwise ready an item that is stowed. As part of this action, you can put away something already in hand. You could holster a handgun and pull out a grenade, for example.
- Reload: The Reload Minor action functions as the Reload action (see above), but it applies only to weapons whose reload value indicates that they can be reloaded as a Minor action.

#### Variable Actions
- Use a Power: You attempt to use a special ability granted by a talent, specialization, or any other source, including arcane spells or psychic powers. This may be a major action, minor action, or free action depending on the power and may require a specific ability test.
- Reload: You reload a missile weapon. This may be a major action, minor action, or free action depending on the weapon, and your abilities.

#### Free Actions
- Pulling the first item from inventory during a turn (pulling additional items requires the Object Interaction action)
- Drawing one weapon
- Opening an unlocked door
- Communicating quickly (making a brief comment, speaking a short statement, whistling to alert a companion, and so forth)
- Using an object in a simple way (dropping something held, opening an unlocked cupboard, pushing a button, and so forth)
- Picking up a small item close at hand

#### Reactions
You get one voluntary Reaction. You can make any number of involuntary reactions susck as Quickness, Willpower, Stamina, Intuition checks in a round.
- Attack of Opportunity when something leaves your threatened square you can make a melee attack
- Counterspell if you are a Magician
- Any Spell that is a Reaction
- Anything else that is considered a Reaction

### Cover Mechanics

You usually don’t have to take any action to avoid attacks. It’s a reflex, and covered by your Defense score. You might take actions to modify your Defense, however, such as Dodge.

Taking cover is a special case. In modern games, the prevalence of firearms makes it prudent to put something between yourself and their firing arcs. You can move behind cover.

Cover provides a bonus to your Defense against all ranged attacks.


| Rating | Defense Bonus              | Ranged Attack Penalty     |
| ------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 1      | 2                          | –1                        |
| 2      | 3                          | –2                        |
| 3      | 4                          | –3                        |
| Total  | Can’t be attacked at range | Can’t make ranged attacks |

### Attacks

An attack is rolled as 3D6 + Agility (Ranged or Unarmed) / Strength (Armed) + Relevent Skill Rating

For example if making a ranged attack with Agility 3 and Automatics 4 they would add 7 to their roll. 

The attacker needs to exceed the Defense of the target to hit.

#### Accuracy

All weapons have an Accuracy score that acts as a Limit for that weapon. Accuracy scores reflect the quality and craftsmanship of a weapon and determine the number of Effect that can be applied in a skill test.

Melee weapons, those that were made for combat, have an average Accuracy of 5. Improvised weapons— items that can be used, however awkwardly, to inflict damage but are not designed for combat, such as a golf club or frying pan—usually have an accuracy of 4. Random objects used as weapons that are very unwieldy or heavy (like a chair, barstool, or refrigerator) generally have an Accuracy of 3. Standard Weapons that are in poor condition or broken can have their Accuracy reduced by 1.

Unarmed attacks use the Inherent Limit [Physical] as determined by the Attributes of the character and do not have an Accuracy rating. Items used as part of the Unarmed Attack, also use the Physical limit.

Most basic ranged weapons have an accuracy of 4 or 5. Specialized ranged weapons, like some sniper rifles, have an accuracy of 6 or higher. Improvised ranged weapons have an Accuracy of 3, and broken, old, damaged, or otherwise flawed ranged weapons can have their Accuracy reduced by 1, to a minimum of 1.

### Damage

Involved as they are in an illegal and often hazardous line of work, runners get hurt and get hurt often. What kind of damage, how bad an injury is, and how much it affects the character vary greatly depending on the situation.

#### Types of Injury

Damage in Sixfinity is defined as Physical or Stun. Each type of damage is tracked on a separate Condition Monitor.

##### Physical Damage

Physical damage, the most dangerous type, is the kind done by guns, explosions, most melee weapons, and many magic spells. Weapons that inflict Physical damage have the letter “P” following their Damage Value. Physical damage takes a longer time to heal.


##### Stun Damage

Stun damage—bruising, muscle fatigue, and the like— is the kind done by fists, kicks, blunt weapons, stun rounds, shock weapons, concussion grenades, and some magic spells. If something does Stun damage, the letter “S” follows the Damage Value. Stun damage takes a shorter time to heal.


### Resistance

If a creature or character has an effect which gives them resistance to a type of damage (see damage types) they take half damage from that source.

### Vulnerability

If a creature or character has an effect which gives them vulnerability to a type of damage (see damage types) they take double damage from that source. 

### Healing

- First Aid: Another character can aid you with a First Aid action, as described under Major Actions in this chapter. You can’t benefit from another First Aid action until you take more damage (there is only so much benefit you can gain from basic care).
- You can take a breather after a combat encounter. This is a 5-minute rest that lets you catch your breath, tend to minor cuts and abrasions, drink some water, and so on. After a breather, you get back 5 + Body in Physical Health. You can take only one breather after an encounter. If you were at 0 Physical Health when the combat encounter ended, you cannot take a breather at all.
- You can get some sleep. If you can get at least 6 hours of restful sleep, you can recover Physical Health Rating x 10 + Body in Physical Health.
- You receive extended medical attention. Another character can tend to your injuries with a {Threshold} 13 Logic (Medicine) test that lasts 1 hour or is concurrent with sleep as above. The character in charge of your care must use proper medical tools and supplies (found easily in any clinic, hospital, or doctor’s office). Success means you recover an additional amount of Physical Health equal to 5 + treating character’s Logic + treating chaacters Medicine Rating.

Breather = 5 min rest, regain 5 + BOD Physical Health. One per scene. Not if you hit 0.

##### First Aid Table

| Medicine Check {Threshold} | Result                                                                                         | First Aid Kit Required |

| 10                         | Smother the flames on one combatant that is Burning.                                           | No                     |
| Poison DC                  | Give a combatant advantage on their next Stamina reaction against poison.                      | Yes                    |
| Poison DC                  | Allow a combatant to make a saving throw to end an ongoing effect imposed by a poison or drug. | Yes                    |

### Damage Types

Damage comes from three main sources: impact, ballistic, and penetrating attacks. There are six elemental/other damage types they are all considered Penetrating damage.

Impact damage is inflicted by weapons and attacks that rely on sheer force, such as unarmed strikes and most hand-to-hand weapons. Most armor protects against impact damage, providing whatever Armor Rating is listed.

Ballistic damage usually comes from firearms or shrapnel, and cuts through armor not specifically designed to stop it. In most cases, only modern bullet-resistant armor protects against it, with an Armor Rating.

Penetrating damage ignores most armor and comes from special weapons, hazards, and abilities. Very few things reduce penetrating damage.

#### Stun Damage
If a character recieves enough stun damage to reach zero hitpoints they suffer the Stunned Condition.

#### Impact Damage Types:
- Bludgeoning
- Piercing
- Slashing

#### Ballistic Damage Types
Usually from bullets

#### Penetrating Damage Types
- Acid (any type of corrosive effect)
- Cold (frostbite and other effects of extreme cold)
- Electrical (electric shocks and burns)
- Explosive (intense shock waves in air or water)
- Fire (heat and open flame)
- Poison (both natural and synthetic toxins)
- Psychic (damage to the mind)

## Chapter 9: Magic

The world is made up of two parts.

The Sleeping World & The Awakened World.

The Sleeping World is unaware of magic. This Chapter focuses on the Awakened World.

The Awakened world is permeated by mana, the energy of magic. Mana is invisible and intangible. It cannot be detected, measured, or influenced by machines, only by living beings. Mana is sensitive. to emotion and responds to the will of the Awakened. It allows magicians to cast spells. Mana also makes the powers of adepts and various Awakened creatures possible.

**Magic Attribute**

Awakened creatures and magical effects have their magical potency measured by either the Magic or Force attributes. Magic is the attribute possessed by Awakened creatures—including humanoids while Force is the principle attribute for magic items and entities of pure mana—spirits and spells.

Magic is a Special attribute that measures the character’s magical power. Like other attributes, Magic has a starting value of 1. The Magic attribute may be increased in the same way as other attributes, to a maximum of 6. Magical study and insight can raise a magician’s Magic attribute beyond the normal maximum though a process called initiation.

If a character’s Magic is ever reduced to 0, she can no longer perform any kind of magic. The magician has “burned out,” losing all magical ability and becoming a mundane forever. She retains all magical skills and knowledge, but lacks the ability to use them. Active skills become Knowledge skills. 

Spells, spirits, and magic items have an attribute known as Force. This measures the magical power of the object, spell, or being. Force is measured on the same scale as humanoid attributes (natural 1 to 6). For spells and items, this is often their only attribute.

**The Three Realms**

Magicians are aware of three “realms” of existence. The first is the physical realm, our natural physical world, and all of its corresponding physical laws. 

On one “side” of us, we have the astral realm. The astral realm occupies the same “space” as the physical plane, but has different “physical” (“astral?”) laws. It is always there, right next door, just a step sideways. It thrives on life, and so emotion, thought, and spirit are emphasized on the astral. Without life, there is no astral space; and so without a thriving gaiasphere to support it, the astral plane does not extend into space. Using what is often called their "third eye" Magicians can see the Astral realm.

On the other side (and curving around, as it were, to meet the astral plane on its far edge) we have the metaplanar realm. The metaplanes are not one place but many, and their true nature and purpose are beyond the ken of ordinary magicians. (See The Planes)

Each realm is separated by a barrier, a wall of sorts that stops us from randomly wandering from one realm into another. Magicians have learned to extend their senses onto the astral realm, to astrally perceive what goes on there. Full magicians can actually leave their physical bodies and project their spirits onto the astral plane. Psychic travel to the metaplanes is also possible, but is a much more complicated affair.

**Magical Lodges**

In order to progress in her studies, a magician must have a collection of symbols, writings,
tools, and other material that allows her to record her progress, gives her room to expand her
knowledge, and assists her in her magical endeavors. Such a collection of items and information is known as a magical lodge. Magicians of the same tradition can share a magical lodge.

A magical lodge is required to improve Magic-linked skills, learn new spells, and perform Ritual Spellcasting. A lodge has a Force rating that is used to measure its power. The Force of a lodge must be at least equal to the skill rating being learned or the force of a spell being cast.

A lodge has a Resource cost of 2 per Force point, and the lodge’s rating can be improved later.

For example if you want to purchase a Force 1 Lodge you need to make a {Threshold} 12 Resource test. A Force 3 Lodge would be a {Threshold} 16. 

The money is spent to buy the supplies used to build the lodge. Once the supplies are gathered, the magician must complete an activation ritual that will “awaken” the lodge and construct its astral presence. The actual process requires 1 day per point of Force desired. An activated lodge acts as an astral barrier. Any magicians involved in the activation of the lodge are unaffected by this barrier, and can allow other astral forms to pass through it at will. A lodge contains the astral signatures of the magicians who activated it (see Astral Signatures), and is magically linked to them. This link can be tracked using astral projection (see Astral Tracking).

To increase the rating of an existing lodge, additional materials must be acquired. An activation ritual must also be performed, taking a number of days equal to the difference between the current Force and the desired Force. The cost of searching and gathering can be simplified to a cost of Resource 2 per Force point as above. Improving a Force 4 lodge to Force 6, for example, would cost Resource {Threshold} 22 (6 * 2 + 10) and take two days of ritual.

### Spellcasting

When a magician casts a spell, the player first chooses the Force of the spell and then rolls her `3D6 + Spellcasting + Magic VS {Threshold}`. Other sources of power (foci, spirit spellcasting aid) and Visibility modifiers may affect the final outcome. The success of a spell is measured by the {Threshold} on the test.

Many times the {Threshold} is the targets Defense for targeted spells. 

Steps for Spellcasting:

- Step 1: Choose a Spell. She can cast any spell she knows. Remember you can only have one Concentration Spell active at a time.
- Step 2: Choose the Force. The maximum Force a spell can be cast at equals the spellcaster’s Magic rating x 2. 
- Step 3: Choose the targets. Area spells you choose a location for the center, targeted spells you choose a target withing Line of Sight.
- Step 4: Make the Spellcasting Test. `3D6 + Spellcasting + Magic` VS {Threshold}. (Unless opposed the {Threshold} is 10 + Force)
- Step 5: Determine the effect. Some spells only require a success and the Effect determines how effective the spell is. Opposed test against living targets often trigger Willpower or other Reactions. Spells cast on astral objects like mana barriers or active foci are resisted with Force. **The Effect CANNOT exceed the Spells Force**
- Step 6: Fatigue Test. `3D6 + Willpower VS. 9 + Spells Force` if you succeed you cast it with minimal issues, if you fail you suffer effects (see Spell Fatigue below)
- Step 7: Concentration. Many spells can be sustained for as long as the magician is willing to concentrate on the spell, as noted in the spell’s Duration. If you take damage while maintaining concentration you must succeed on a `3D6 + Willpower Vs 10 or Half Damage taken rounded down up to 25 whichever is higher`

### Counterspelling

**This is considered a Reaction.**

Counterspelling is used to interrupt other spells, either as they are being cast or while they are sustained. To interrupt a spell as it is being cast a Counterspelling roll `3D6 + Counterspelling + Magic` is rolled versus the opposing Spellcasting roll `3D6 + Spellcasting + Magic`, if the Counterspell is higher the spell is canceled. Force does not come into play here because the Spell has not been completed yet.

For example Paige is fighting another Mage in a bar. The other Mage is preparing to cast Fireball. Paige rolls `3D6 + Counterspelling + Magic` she has a Counterspelling of 4 and a Magic of 5, the rolls a 12 and ends up with a 21. The enemy Mage has a Magic of 4 and a Spellcasting of 4, rolls a 12 on 3D6. Since Paige beat the enemy Mage's roll the spell is Countered and no Fireball is cast. 

When dispelling it is very similar, a Counterspelling + Magic Opposed Test is made against the target spell’s Force + caster’s Magic, if the roll is greater than the {Threshold} of the spell it is dispelled.

For Example if Paige is trying to dispel a sealed door. She rolls `3D6 + Counterspelling + Magic vs {Threshold} from the Gamemaster`. The GM knows that the caster had a Force of 6 for the spell and their magic was 6 so `{Threshold} = 10 + 6 + 6` the {Threshold} is 22.


### Force

A spell’s only attribute is its Force—the measure of the spell’s raw power. A spell’s Force helps determine its effectiveness and its Fatigue. Thee Force of a spell is chosen by the caster during spellcasting, typically at a value up to the Magic attribute of the magician who cast it. The maximum Force that a spell can be cast at is equal to twice the character’s Magic.

For simplicity, you may wish to decide that spells are always cast at a Force equal to the character’s Magic attribute unless otherwise noted. This certainly makes tracking Fatigue rolls easier.

A spell’s Force limits the Effect that can be achieved on the Spellcasting Test. So if you cast a Force 3 spell and get 5 Effect, only 3 of those count. In other words, Force has a limiting effect on spells—the more oomph you put into the spell, the better you can succeed with it. 

### Spell Fatigue 

When using a power, the player rolls a fatigue test for the character. This is a test with a target number of `{Threshold} = 9 + Spells Force / 2 rounded down`. Often times spells have a Fatigue Value or FV listed this represents the `Spell Force / 2 Rounded down` math already done.

Fatigue tests are Willpower Reactions. `3D6 + Willpower VS. 9 + Fatigue Value`

If the test succeeds, using the power costs the character only negligible effort. If the fatigue test fails, the character takes the Fatigue Value in Stun Damage (see Stun Damage) if they suffer enough Stun damage to reduce them to zero Physical Health they are Stunned for 1 Minute. After that they are 1 point away from Stunned and Exhausted.

- Exhausted: The character is nearly spent. An exhausted character has a –3 penalty to all tests, moves at half their normal speed, and cannot Run or Charge. 

Additionally, if the character loses more than half their Physical Health while exhausted, they become unconscious for 1d6 hours, or until restored to greater than half their maximum Physical Health. After 6 hours unconscious, they regain 10 + Body in Physical Health and regain consciousness.


Characters can recover from fatigue by resting, as follows:
- Taking a 5-minute breather is enough to recover BOD + STR in Stun Damage. You gain this benefit in addition to the normal amount of Physical Health you recover from a breather.
- Resting for at least 4 hours, with only light activity (talking, reading, and the like, but not standing or riding) allows you to recover from all Stun Damage, so long as you also eat and drink something during that time.
- Sleeping for at least 6 hours allows you to recover from being exhausted, as well as all Stun Damage in addition to the Physical Health benefits of such rest.

**Optional Rule**

Simple Fatigue.

Gamemasters and players should keep the following system in mind for making spell Fatigue calculation easier. Rather than choosing the Force and calculating the Fatigue each time a spell is cast, simply assume that spells are always cast at a Force equal to the character’s Magic attribute. In this case, the Fatigue for each spell can be pre-calculated and written on the character sheet, so you do not have to bother calculating it during actual gameplay.

If a character decides at some point to cast a spell at a different Force value, simply modify the Fatigue by +1 or –1 for every 2 points the player increases or decreases the Force, respectively.

For example, a player who has a mage with Magic 5 can assume that she always casts her Acid Stream spell at Force 5, and so she writes the Fatigue down as FV 5 (based on Acid Stream’s Fatigue formula for Force 5). If she decides to cast the spell at Force 3 instead, the Fatigue is modified to FV 4 (base FV 5 minus 1 per 2 points of Force reduction). If she decides to cast it at Force 7, her FV would be 6 (+1 per 2 points)—and the Fatigue if failed would be Physical Damage in lieu of Fatigue (see overcasting below) as the Force exceeds her Magic.

### Overcasting

If a caster wants the Spells Force to exceed their Magic Rating (maximum force is Magic x 2) they will suffer more dangerous outcomes than simple fatigue. If they fail the Fatituge test they will take the Fatigue Value as Damage instead of suffering Exhaustion levels as above. 

For example is Paige has a Magic of 5 and decides to cast Acid Stream at Force 7 the Fatigue Value (based on the spells formula) would be 6. Since The Force 7 exceeds Paige's Magic if she fails her Fatigue check (`3D6 + Willpower VS. {Threshold} 15`) Paige will take 6 points of Physical damage instead of suffering exhaustion. 

While dangerous it represents a magician putting their life into a spell. In some settings, some spells **require** it to be physical.

### Learning New Spells

Before a magician can cast a spell, she must learn it. A magician can learn a spell from either a spell formula or from another magician, but the source has to be of a compatible tradition (gamemaster’s discretion). A magician must have a magical lodge in order to experiment with and master what she has learned, adapting it to her own personal style and understanding of the magical world.

For most magicians (especially mages), the archaic master-apprentice model of learning a spell has largely passed by the wayside. Given the proliferation of magical information on the Net, learning from formulae has become the default method of learning new spells. Finding a spell formula is as easy as checking the Net. 

Certain spells (especially combat spells and mental manipulations) are illegal or controlled in some jurisdictions, so characters must engage caution when pursuing them, or look to black market providers/teachers. In addition, a character must expend 5 permanent Experience points per spell learned. The costs are the same whether the instruction is in person or through the Net.

Once a magician has access to a spell formula or teacher, she makes a Spellcasting + Logic (15,5, 1 day) Extended Test (see Extended Tests). Instructors can provide Help and grnt advantage on the tests. All injury modifiers apply, as do distractions for sustaining spells, poor conditions, and so on.

A character engaged in learning a spell must work on it for consecutive days. Learning a spell does not require all of the character’s
attention during those days, but the magician must be able to devote 8 hours each day solely to learning the spell until she has it mastered.
Should a day be missed before the test is completed, the character automatically fails the test and does not learn the spell. No Experience is expended in this case, but any money and time spent on instruction is lost. 

### Traditions

#### Hermetic Tradition

Concept: The scientific study of magic as a complex pattern of elemental forces that can be controlled with the right formulae and rituals.

- Combat: Fire Magic
- Detection: Air Magic
- Physical Health: Man
- Illusion: Water Magic
- Maniuplation: Earth Magic

A hermetic magician’s ability to perform magic comes from the study of a complex set of theories that describe mana, the dimensions of astral space, and how they interact with the physical world. The science of thaumaturgy, as this discipline is called, draws those who rely on logic and reason as their means of evaluating the world. As with any vibrant field, while the basics are largely agreed upon, the theories as to how it all works and what magic can do are as varied as the mages themselves. By seeking understanding, mages can perform magic through ritual and focused power of will.

Mages are scholars who study and practice magic using tried and established formulas and procedures. Mages continually research the theories and laws of magic, seeking a deeper understanding of the structure of the universe. As their knowledge increases, so does their power.

In Veilstriders Hermetic Mages attend school at Arkham in Mass. 

Examples: Harry Dresden

#### Sorcerous Tradition

Concept: The channeling of internal magical power through an object to manifest power

- Combat: Air Magic
- Detection: Earth Magic
- Physical Health: Water Magic
- Illusion: Man
- Maniuplation: Fire Magic

This tradition is taught to people who are born with magical latent ability. Taught to channel it through an object like a wand.

Examples: Harry Potter

#### Shamanic Tradition

- Combat: Beasts
- Detection: Water
- Physical Health: Earth
- Illusion: Air
- Manipulation: Man

To a shaman, the world is filled with living spirits, powers the shaman calls on for magical aid. Shamanic magicians summon spirits that are tied to nature: air, earth, water, beasts, and man. To a shaman, these are the spirits of the natural world. They are spirits of skies and storms, of mountains and valleys, of lakes and rivers, of birds and rats, and of the mass of humanity, for even man is a part of nature. Communion and trafficking with such spirits is a venerable and honored tradition among shamans.

Examples: Native American Magic.

### The Astral World

While the physical realm is the world characters know and walk in every day, another realm exists alongside it, invisible and unnoticed by most of the people on the planet. that place is called the astral plane, a sort of photo-negative of the physical world where only living things—things infused with mana—are real.

Mana, the essence of magic, flows from the metaplanes into our physical world and through it to the astral plane, where it pools and infuses the astral plane with its nature.

The astral plane is fueled by the life force that exists in and on our planet, and the general aura of that force illuminates the astral world at all times with an ambient glow. Things that exist only on the physical plane can be seen and heard from the astral, albeit with blurred features and indistinct sound—emotional content registers far more strongly than exact details. 

#### Astral Willpower

Many Awakened characters can perceive the astral plane from the physical world. This ability is called astral perception sometimes called "Third Eye". It is the primary sense used in the astral plane; it shows auras, allowing magicians to examine living creatures in the physical world as well as creatures who live on the astral plane. Astral Willpower is available to characters who take the Magician quality during character generation.

It takes a Minor Action to shift one’s perception from the astral to the physical, and another to shift it back again (it is not possible to see both at the same time, though almost everything in physical space is reflected on the astral, albeit without detail). A character using astral perception is considered dual-natured, active on both the physical and astral planes simultaneously.

While astral perception allows an Awakened character to sense the astral plane, actually interpreting what is sensed takes practice. Interpreting auras to gain information about the person or thing to whom they belong is called Assensing. A magician who wishes to learn more about an aura must make an Assensing test `Magic + Perception Rating` test against the {Threshold} as outlined on the Assensing Table (below). Without attempting to read an aura, a magician can still get an impression of what type of aura it is (spell, spirit, living creature, etc.).

Like physical perception, a character using astral perception should not need to make a test to see things that are immediately obvious (and since astral forms are bright and vibrant, this means that most astral forms are easily noticed). An actual test should only be called for when an astral being is specifically trying to hide, or when a character is trying to astrally observe in detail; in both these situations, an Assensing Test is made.

By assensing something’s aura, a magician can gain information. The auras of living beings show their general health, emotions, and magical nature (if any). Enchanted objects show their magical nature. Non-magical and non-living objects have only gray, lackluster shadows rather than auras, but pick up impressions from being in contact with living auras. Assensing can read any impressions left behind on an object.

Spells cast upon an individual show up as a separate aura surrounding that person for the duration of the spell. Once a spell has been rendered permanent, the aura is no longer present. It is occasionally possible to see the traces that magic spells leave behind in a target’s aura; see Astral Signatures for more information.

Whenever you have to perform a physical, non-magical task (shooting a gun, driving a car, and so forth) while astrally perceiving, you suffer Disadvantage on the roll. While astrally perceiving, a magician can cast mana spells at astral opponents. Other astral forms can engage an astrally perceiving magician in astral combat or cast mana spells at him as well.

Astral perception is a psychic sense that is not linked to the character’s physical sight. A blind magician can still magically perceive the astral plane and the creatures and auras within. Likewise, deaf magicians can “hear” in astral space.

| 30          | An accurate diagnosis of any disease or toxins which afflict the subject. Who their first born child is, what they had for breakfast              |


#### Astral Signatures

Magical skills and abilities produce an astral signature on anything affected by them, which is detectable using assensing. An astral signature is the magical “fingerprint” of the Awakened creature who created it. A signature lasts for a number of hours equal to a magical effects Force after the effect ends. Foci and other magical items (like magical lodges) always contain the astral signature of their owner (or owners). A character can attempt to read an astral signature with an Assensing Test. A {Threshold} 20+ is required to detect the signature. Once seen, a signature can be recognized if the character sees it again (perhaps requiring a memory test). With a {Threshold} 25, she also gets an impression of what magical effect created the signature (the magical skill used and the general class of spell or spirit).

Magical forensic investigators use astral signatures to gather information about criminal magicians, so characters should be careful about leaving astral signatures where they are likely to be seen by anyone who knows them.

A magician using astral perception may take a number of Major Actions equal to the Force of an astral signature to erase it completely.

### Initiation

As Awakened characters grow in power, they often find that their initial explorations into magic and the astral plane can only take them so far in understanding and increasing their abilities. In order to increase their powers, magicians will often choose to undergo initiation in the mysteries of magic, the astral world, and the metaplanes in hope of increasing their connection with the Awakened world.

Initiation is measured in grades, beginning with Grade 1 and increasing. At the end of a character’s first initiation, she is a Grade 1 initiate. When she completes her second initiation, she is a Grade 2 initiate, and so on. The numerical system is for tracking initiation levels in game terms: each tradition refers to grades of initiation in their own way. 

The cost to initiate is equal to 10 + (Grade x 3) in Experience points. Characters who wish to initiate must pay that cost in order to achieve their new grade.
 
A character’s initiate grade cannot exceed her Magic attribute. If a character’s Magic is reduced below her initiate grade, she loses that level of initiation and the metamagic she gained with it.

#### Initiate Powers

**Increased Magic**

An initiate’s natural maximum for the Magic attribute is 6 + her grade of initiation. She will still have to pay normally to increase her Magic attribute. 

**Metaplanar Access**

Upon a character’s first initiation, a character usually gains access to a special Demiplane for their Initiation. 

**More Powers**

Some settings have more powers for Initiation.

### Spells

How to read a spell.

- Category: This describes the manner in which a spell affect its target, as well as what spirits will be associated with that type of spell. The categories are: Combat, Detection, Physical Health, Illusion, and Manipulation.
- Type: Spell Type is either mana (M) or physical (P). Mana spells affect their targets through the mana that permeates the astral and physical planes affecting the target in a magical and spiritual manner that is only effectively resisted by the Willpower of a living or magical being. Physical spells directly target the body; resistance relies on the target’s Stamina. Only mana spells can affect astral forms. Either type of spell may be used in the physical world, but mana spells cannot affect non-living targets.
- Range: All spells have a range at which they can be cast. For most spells, the range is line of sight (LOS). If the caster can see the target, regardless of distance, it can be affected. Some spells, particularly health spells, require the caster to touch the intended target in order for the spell to work. Other spells affect all valid targets within an area, defined as a circle with a radius equal to the spell’s Force in yards.
- Test & {Threshold}: The type of test required if opposed, or the {Threshold} required (usually 10 + Force)
- Duration: Duration is either Instant, Concentration, or Permanent. Instant spells end the moment they are cast, and their full effects are felt immediately. Concentration spells last for as long as the magician concentrates on them. Permanent spells must be Concentrationated for a short time, after which their effects become “natural” and no longer require magic or concentration to maintain. The time required to make a spell’s effects permanent is equal to twice the Fatgiue Value in Combat Turns.
- Fatigue Value: This describes the Fatigue Value required for the Fatigue Test. Fatigue is based on the spell’s Force; the more powerful the spell, the more exhausting it is to cast. Fatigue is variable, based on the spell’s Force ÷ 2, rounded down, and modified by Fatigue modifiers appropriate to each spell. Failed Fatigue Tests cause Stun Damage and possibly Exhaustion (see Spell Fatigue above), unless the spell is overcast (cast at a Force higher than the magician’s Magic see above), in which case it causes Fatigue Value in Physical damage. Note that no Fatigue Value can ever be less than 1.


### Combat Spells

Combat spells use mana to create damaging effects, either by direct or indirect means. Think of Direct spells as Saving Throw Spells and Indirect Spells as To Hit Spells. Though Indirect Area spells require a Quickness Reaction.

Direct Combat spells channel damaging power directly into the target’s inner being, affecting them from within, and so bypass armor (but not Toughness). 

Indirect Combat spells create an external damaging medium (often elemental in nature) that is used to attack the target. 

**Direct Combat Spells**: Handle these as an Opposed Test. The caster’s `Spellcasting + Magic` is resisted by the target’s Stamina (for physical spells) or Willpower (for mana spells), plus Counterspelling (if available). 

The caster needs beat the opposed roll by at least 1 to take effect. Direct Combat spells affect the target from the inside, so armor does not help with resistance. Toughness does help with the damage though.

> For example Paige casts Manabolt at a Security Guard. She has a 5 Spellcasting and 5 Magic. She rolls `3D6 + 5 + 5` she rolls 17 the Security Guard has a Stamina of 3 and no Counterspell so he rolls `3D6 +3` to resist the spell.

Direct Combat spells cast against nonliving objects are treated as Success Tests; the caster must achieve Effect to beat the item’s Object Resistance. Effect increase damage as normal (the object does not get a resistance test).

Direct Combat spells involve channeling mana directly into a target as destructive and damaging energies rather than generating a damaging effect. Affecting the target on this fundamental level with raw mana requires more focus and more power than producing other spell effects. After the Spellcasting is resisted the caster choses whether or not to apply any Effect to increase the damage value of the spell as normal.

**Indirect Combat Spells**: Indirect Combat spells are treated like ranged combat attacks; the caster makes a `Spellcasting + Magic` Success Test versus the target’s Defense. 

Indirect Combat spells (also commonly called AOE spells) generate a spell construct at the point of origin (the caster) which travels down the mystic link to the chosen target, whereupon it discharges and the effect defined in the spell description manifests. The spell traverses the distance between the caster and the target near instantly, but travels over the physical or astral plane to do so only to take effect when it “hits”. Hence, Indirect Spells are handled as ranged attacks and require a physically solid target or astrally active target to hit. As they travel down the link to the chosen target such effects may be impeded by physical obstacles or mana barriers. They may impact transparent obstacles (such as glass) and do not “bounce” off reflective surfaces used for line of sight. Instead the spell takes effect at the point of contact with an obstructing barrier. In the case of mana barriers, use the standard rules for casting through barriers, but if the spell’s Force is insufficient to beat the mana barrier it “fizzles” at the point of contact with the barrier.

If the spell reaches the chosen target and it fails to dodge with Quickness (+ Counterspelling, if available) ({Threshold} 10 + Spells Force), the target then resists damage with Toughness + armor. Each point reduces the Damage Value. The target takes the damage left over, if any after the Toughness and Armor Protection is deducted. Note that nonliving objects resist damage from an Indirect Combat spell with their Armor rating x 2 (see Barriers). Note that unlike other spells, Indirect Combat spells may affect other targets that the caster cannot see if they are caught within the spell’s area of effect.

**Elemental Effects**: Many Indirect Combat spells utilize damaging elemental energies such as Fire damage, Electrical damage, etc (see Damage Types).

Spells with elemental components also create secondary effects on the environment. For example, a Fireball might start fires, cook off ammo, ignite fuel tanks, and set fire to armor and clothing all over the blast zone. An Acid Stream can melt surrounding material into smoking sludge. These are noted in the special case damage descriptions.

**Damage Value**: The base Damage Value for Combat spells is based on Force in flat damage, which is chosen by the magician at the time of casting. Any Effect scored on the Spellcasting Test increase the Damage Value by 1D6 per Effect. Each spell description notes whether damage is Stun (S) or Physical (P).

### Detection Spells

Detection also known as Divination spells give the subject a new sense, beyond the normal five senses, for as long as they are maintained. They are cast upon either the magician or a subject within Touch range. Using the sense may require the subject to take a Minor Action to Perception in Detail. Detection spells are either directional (like normal sight), area effect (work in all directions at once, like hearing), or psychic (providing some other special “sense” such as telepathy or precognition). Additionally the sense is either active or passive (see below).

**Active**: The sense actively analyzes or seeks out certain information when the subject concentrates on it. Active Detection spells are treated as an Opposed Test, pitting the caster’s `Spellcasting + Magic vs. The target’s Willpower (+ Counterspelling, if available)`; magical objects resist with Force. Against objects, handle the spell as a Success Test with a {Threshold} based on the Object Resistance. The Detection Spell Results table provides guidelines for how thoroughly the sense works, based on Effect scored. Note that Counterspelling may be used to defend against active Detection spells, even if the magician is not aware of them (see Counterspelling).

**Passive**: A passive sense is simply “on” and passes along any appropriate sensory input without any sort of interpretation (similar to hearing). The Spellcasting Test serves as a magical Willpower test, against an appropriate {Threshold} determined by the gamemaster. Other effects are noted in the spell descriptions. The Detection Spell Results table provides guidelines for how thoroughly the sense works, based on Effect.

Note that Counterspelling cannot be used to “defend” against the sense provided by passive Detection spells.

**Range**: The standard sensory range for a Detection spell is the spell’s `Force x Magic` in yards. For extended range Detection spells, the effective range of the new sense is `Force x Magic x 10 yards`. Note that any of the standard range spells listed below may be learned with an extended range instead (adding +2 FV).

Note also that a separate test is not needed for each potential target in range of the sense. The character simply makes a single `Spellcasting + Magic Test` and compares the results against each potential target in range, using the Detection Spell Results table to determine the result. If a caster sustains a Detection spell, new targets may be detected as they enter the range of the spell; in this case, the gamemaster simply applies the results of the original `Spellcasting + Magic Test` to see if the new targets are noticed.

**Glitches**: A glitch on a Detection Spellcasting Test may result in false or misleading information. Likewise, a critical glitch may inflict extra (+2 FV) or Physical Drain, may temporarily strip the character of a sense, or may inexplicably apply the sense to others (particularly opponents) in range.

**Detection Results Table**
| {Threshold} | Results                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 10          | Only general knowledge, no details. Detect Life Example: A group of humanoids.                                                              |
| 15          | Major details only, no minor details. Detect Life Example: Three male orcs and a female troll, coming your way.                             |
| 20          | Major and minor details, with some minor details obscured or missing. Detect Life Example: They are all running/armed. The troll is leading |
| 25          | Completely detailed information. Detect Life Example: The troll is your contact, Moira she’s wounded and being chased by three orcs         |


#### Analyze Device (Active, Directional)
- Type: P 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2)

This spell allows the subject to analyze the purpose and operation of a device or piece of equipment within range of the sense. The caster must gain enough hits on the Spellcasting Test to beat the item’s Object Resistance. Each Effect gives the subject a +1 while operating the device, and allows the subject to ignore any skill defaulting modifiers for using the device while the spell is sustained.


#### Analyze Truth (Active, Directional)
- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2)

The subject can tell whether a target’s statements are the truth. Halftruths or falsehoods the target believes to be true are not detected by this spell.

The subject must hear a statement in person (with the target within range) to know whether it is true.

#### Clairaudience (Passive, Directional)
- Type: M 
- Range: T

- FV: (F ÷ 2) –1

The subject can hear distant sounds as if physically present at a chosen point within the sensory range of the spell. The “listening point” may be moved to any other point within range of the spell. While using clairaudience, the subject cannot use her normal hearing. This spell does not translate visual images, only sounds (and only sounds within the subject’s natural range of hearing; augmented hearing does not apply).

#### Clairvoyance (Passive, Directional)
- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) –1

The subject can see distant scenes as if physically present at a chosen point within the sensory range of the spell. The “visual point” may be moved to any other point within range of the spell. The subject cannot use normal vision or astral perception while using it. This spell does not translate sound, only vision. Any augmented vision possessed by the subject does not function through this spell, nor does astral perception. Magicians cannot use clairvoyance to target others with spells.

#### Combat Sense (Active, Psychic)
- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 2

The subject can subconsciously analyze combat and other dangerous situations within range, sensing events a split-second before they happen. Every Effect on the Spellcasting Test adds +1 Reaction on Surprise Tests and when defending against ranged and melee attacks for the duration of the spell.

The subject detects all of a specified type of object within range of the sense and knows their number and relative location. Each type of object requires a separate spell (Detect Guns, Detect Computers, Detect Explosives, and so forth).

#### Mindlink (Active, Psychic)
- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1

Mindlink allows the caster and one voluntary subject to communicate mentally, exchanging conversation, emotions, and mental images. One Effect on the Spellcasting Test is enough to establish the link. The subject must remain within range of the spellcaster for the Mindlink to work.

#### Mind Probe (Active, Directional)
- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 2

This spell allows the subject to telepathically probe the mind of a specific target within range of the sense (chosen when the spell is cast). The target is aware of the probing, though they may not know the source of the spell. If the caster gains one or more Effect, consult the Mind Probe Results table (below) for the information gained. The subject may probe for one piece of information per Major Action. Additional uses of Mind Probe against the same target within a number of hours equal to the target’s Willpower are at a –2 modifier per previous Spellcasting attempt.

**Mind Probe Results table**
| {Threshold} | Result                                                                                                     |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 15          | The subject can read the target’s surface thoughts only.                                                   |
| 20          | The subject can fi nd out anything the target consciously knows and view the target’s memories.            |
| 25          | The subject can probe the target’s subconscious, for psychological quirks, deep fears, or hidden memories. |

### Physical Health Spells

Physical Health spells can heal physical injury, cure diseases (or inflict them), detoxify poisons or drugs (or mimic their effects), as well as modify attributes. No techniques currently known to magic can erase Stun damage or cure psychological conditions.

All health spells require the caster to touch the subject of the spell. This “laying on hands” is traditional in magical healing lore the world over. Physical Health spells are handled as Success Tests, with Effect providing specified bonuses.

Negative Physical Health spells: Spells that negatively affect a character require an Opposed Test, pitting `Spellcasting + Magic vs. The target’s appropriate attribute (+ Counterspelling, if available)`.

#### Antidote

- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: P 
- FV: (Toxin DV) – 2

This spell helps a poisoned subject to overcome a toxin. It must be applied before the toxin does damage (though an Antidote spell applied afterward may alleviate some side effects, if the gamemaster chooses). The poisoned character receives a modifier on her Toxin Resistance Test (Stamina) equal to the Effect. 

#### Cure Disease

- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: P 
- FV: (Disease DV) – 2

This spell is used at any point after infection to help a patient overcome illness. The infected character receives a number of additional dice on her Disease Resistance Test equal to the spell’s Effect. It does not heal any damage already inflicted by the disease (that takes a separate Healing spell).

#### Decrease [Attribute] (Negative)

- Type: P 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1

This spell weakens the target by decreasing a chosen attribute. A version of this spell exists for each Physical and Mental attribute, but not for Special attributes (Initiative, Courage, Magic). It affects both natural and augmented attributes. The target resists the spell using the attribute affected. If the caster wins, the attribute is reduced by the spell’s Effect. If a Physical attribute is reduced to 0, the victim is incapacitated or paralyzed. If a Mental attribute is reduced to 0, the victim stands about mindlessly confused. Note that decreasing an attribute may affect other derived statistics.

#### Detox

- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: P 
- FV: (Toxin DV) – 4

Detox relieves the side effects of a drug or poison. The Force of the spell must equal or exceed the toxin’s base DV. A single Effect is sufficient to eliminate all symptoms. Detox does not heal or prevent damage done by toxins, but it eliminates any side effects they may have on the victim (dizziness, hallucinations, nausea, pain, and so forth). Detox is the hangover cure of choice among those who can afford it. 

#### Heal

- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: P 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) – 2

Heal repairs physical injuries. It heals an amount of Physical damage equal to the spell’s `Force + Effect from the Spellcasting Test`. Effect can also be used to reduce the base time for the spell to become permanent; each Effect spent this way shaves off 1 Combat Turn. A character can only be magically healed once for any single set of injuries. 

#### Hibernate

- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) – 3

The caster must touch a voluntary or unconscious subject. The spell puts the subject in a form of suspended animation. The subject’s bodily processes are slowed by a factor equal to the Effect. For example, If the Effect was 4, the subject’s metabolism is slowed by a factor of 4. Such a subject sealed into a chamber with enough air to keep it alive for a day would be able to last four days.

#### Increase [Attribute]

- Type: P 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) – 2

This spell increases an attribute (natural or augmented) on a voluntary subject. A version of this spell exists for each Physical and Mental attribute, but not for Special attributes (Initiative, Courage, Magic). The Force of the spell must equal or exceed the (augmented) value of the attribute being affected. The attribute is increased by an amount equal to the Effect scored. Each attribute can only be affected by a single Increase Attribute spell at a time.

Note that increasing an attribute may affect other derived statistics (Increase Reaction also affects Initiative, for example, while Increase Stamina will add extra boxes to the character’s Physical Condition Monitor for as long as the spell lasts).

#### Increase Reflexes

- Type: P 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 2

This spell increases the reflexes (Initiative) of a voluntary subject. Each level of increase adds +1 Initiative. The caster must achieve a certain Effect threshold for each level:

- Effect 2: +1 Initiative
- Effect 3: +2 Initiative, +1 Major Action
- Effect 4 (max.): +3 Initiative, +2 Major Actions

A character can only be affected by a single Increase Reflexes spell at a time.

#### Oxygenate

- Type: P 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) – 1

This spell oxygenates the blood of a voluntary subject, providing extra Stamina (+1 for every Effect) to resist suffocation, strangulation, the effects of inhaled gas, or any other effect of oxygen deprivation. The spell also allows the subject to breathe underwater.

#### Prophylaxis

- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) – 2

This spell provides additional Stamina (+1 per Effect) for a voluntary subject to resist infection, drugs, or toxins. The spell does not discriminate between harmful and beneficial drugs, so the subject also resists medicines and other helpful drugs while under the effects of the spell.  Reduce the effect of a beneficial drug by 1 for every Effect of the spell. Two or more Effect prevent the subject from being affected by alcohol while under the effect of this spell.

#### Resist Pain

- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: P 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) – 4

This spell allows the caster to have the same affect of the High Pain Threshold Edge for a number of rounds equal to the Force + Effect of the Spellcasting Test. 


#### Stabilize

- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: P 
- FV: (Overflow damage) – 2

When applied to a character who is at Physical Health 0 and dying, this spell stabilizes all vital functions and prevents the character from dying. The spell’s Force must equal or exceed the overflow damage already taken when the spell starts. The full time must be taken for the spell to become Permanent before the character is stabilized; Effect reduce the time it takes by 1 Combat Turn each. If successful, the spell prevents the character from taking further damage from Physical Damage Overflow.

### Illusion Spells

No matter how realistic they are, illusions cannot directly cause permanent harm. They can cause distractions, loss of balance or orientation, and even symptoms like nausea or pain. All such effects vanish as soon as the caster drops the illusion. Illusions can certainly cause harm by manipulating the senses so a victim walks into traffic or off a high building, for example, but they cannot directly cause damage.

Obvious illusions are used solely for entertainment and cannot fool subjects into believing they are real. Realistic illusions seem completely real. Single-sense illusions affect only one sense. Full sensory illusions affect all senses. Though mana-based illusions can be created on the astral plane, their magical auras give them away as illusions to anyone who makes a successful Assensing Test (see Astral Willpower). Illusions cannot fool assensing to disguise or create auras.

Mana Illusions: Mana-based illusion spells affect the mind and are ineffective against technological viewing systems like cameras. Mana illusions are resisted by Willpower + Counterspelling (if any). Some mana illusions affect the target’s senses directly, others affect the senses of anyone perceiving the subject of the spell (though the spellcaster is not affected by her own spell). 

Physical Illusions: Physical illusion spells create actual images or alter physical properties, such as light or sound. Physical illusions are effective against technological systems, assuming the caster achieves enough Effect to meet the Object Resistance threshold. They are resisted by `Intuition + Counterspelling (if any)`; non-living devices do not get a resistance test. The spellcaster must generate more Effect than the observer for the illusion to be considered real. If the spell is not completely resisted, the character is fully affected by the illusion.

#### Confusion (Realistic, Multi-Sense)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2)


#### Mass Confusion (Realistic, Multi-Sense, Area)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 2


#### Chaos (Realistic, Multi-Sense)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1


#### Chaotic World (Realistic, Multi-Sense, Area)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 3


These spells produce a storm of conflicting sensations and images to confuse the senses. For each Effect on the Spellcasting Test, the target suffers a –1 modifier to all tests from the distraction. Confusion affects a single target. Mass Confusion is an area spell. The Chaos spell is a physical version of Confusion (above), so it also affects technological systems and sensing devices. Chaotic World is an area version of Chaos.

#### Entertainment (Obvious, Multi-Sense, Area)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1


#### Trid Entertainment (Obvious, Multi-Sense, Area)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 2


These area spells create obvious, but entertaining, illusions. Effect on the Spellcasting Test measure how creative, interesting, and captivating the audience finds the illusion. The caster can reproduce just about anything from her imagination, or re-create something she has experienced. The gamemaster might require additional hits for exacting detail. 

Entertainment affects the minds of the subjects and cannot be detected by non-living sensors. Trid Entertainment is a physical spell, and can be perceived by both living subjects and non-living sensors. These spells are used for amusement as well as art. The entertainment industry uses illusionists as literal “special effects wizards.” Magical designers and artists work to create new and interesting sensations, including sensations that can’t otherwise be experienced in the real world. Only the wealthy can afford the unique experiences offered by such spellcasters firsthand.

#### Invisibility (Realistic, Single-Sense)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2)


#### Improved Invisibility (Realistic, Single-Sense)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1


This spell makes the subject more difficult to detect by normal visual senses (including low-light, thermographic, and other senses that rely on the visual spectrum). The subject is completely tangible and detectable by the other senses (hearing, smell, touch, etc.). Her aura is still visible to astral perception. 

Anyone who might perceive the subject must first successfully resist the spell. Simply make one Spellcasting Test and use the result scored as the threshold for anyone that resists at a later point. Even if the spell is resisted, the subject might remain unnoticed if she wins a Sneaking Test. An invisible character may still be detected by non-visual means, such as hearing or smell. Attacks against invisible targets suffer the Target Hidden modifier (disadvantage) if the attacker is unable to see or otherwise sense the subject of the spell. Invisibility affects the minds of viewers. Improved invisibility creates an actual warping of light around the subject that affects technological sensors as well.


This spell makes the subject more difficult to detect

by normal visual senses (including low-light, thermo-
graphic, and other senses that rely on the visual spec-
trum). The subject is completely tangible and detectable

by the other senses (hearing, smell, touch, and even

taste, if it somehow comes to that). Her aura is still visi-
ble to astral perception.

Anyone who might be in a position to perceive the
subject must first successfully resist the spell. Simply
make one Spellcasting Test and use the hits scored as
the threshold for anyone that resists at a later point.
Even if the spell is resisted, the subject might remain
undetected if she’s good enough with her Sneaking Test. An invisible character may still be detected by non-visual means, such as hearing or smell. Attacks against invisible targets suffer the Blind Fire modifier if the attacker is unable to see or otherwise sense the subject of the spell.

Invisibility affects the minds of viewers. Improved Invisibility mimics the subject’s surroundings from all angles and affects technological sensors as well.

#### Mask (Realistic, Multi-Sense)

- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2)


#### Physical Mask (Realistic, Multi-Sense)

- Type: P 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1


The Mask spell requires the caster to touch the subject. The subject assumes a different physical appearance (of the same basic size and shape) chosen by the caster. This alters the subject’s voice, scent, and other physical characteristics as well. Anyone who might see through the disguise must first successfully resist the spell. Simply make one Spellcasting Test and use the result scored as the {Threshold} for anyone that resists at a later point.

Mask affects the minds of viewers. Physical Mask creates an illusion that affects technological sensors as well.

#### Phantasm (Realistic, Multi-Sense, Area)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) +2


#### Trid Phantasm (Realistic, Multi-Sense, Area)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) +3


These area spells create convincing illusions of any object, creature, or scene the caster desires. They can create an illusion of anything the caster has seen before, from a flower or a credstick to a dragon breathing fire, as long as the illusion is no larger than the spell’s area. Anyone who might pierce the illusion must successfully resist the spell. Simply make one Spellcasting Test and use the result as the threshold for anyone that resists at a later point. Phantasm only affects living beings, while Trid Phantasm affects technological sensors as well. 

#### Hush (Realistic, Single-Sense, Area)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 2


#### Silence (Realistic, Single-Sense, Area)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 3


These spells create an area that damps sound. Sonic attacks into or out of the field, as well as critter powers using a sonic medium (such as Paralyzing Howl), are reduced by –1 per Effect on the Spellcasting Test. Anyone attempting to hear a sound from within or across the silenced area must successfully resist the spell.

Hush is a mana spell and so only affects living beings and magic sonic attacks. Silence affects technological devices and is useful for jamming alarms, detection devices, sonar, and tactical communications, as well as technological sonic weapons.

#### Sneaking (Realistic, Single-Sense)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) +1


Sneaking makes the subject less audible to normal hearing (including augmented hearing). The subject moves in silence, making less or no noise. Things not directly touched by the subject can still make noise, so a character under a Sneaking spell would make no noise knocking on a door, but the door would make noise hitting the floor or wall if it was kicked in.

Anyone who might hear the subject must first successfully resist the spell. Simply make one Spellcasting Test and use the result scored as the threshold for anyone that resists at a later point. Even if the spell is resisted, the subject might remain unnoticed if she wins a Shadowing or Infiltration Test.

### Manipulation Spells

Manipulation spells control, animate, or transform matter and energy.
Many Manipulation spells have a threshold; this is the number of
Spellcasting + Magic hits required for the spell to function. Mental
Manipulations affect the mind, Physical Manipulations affect physical
forms, and Environmental Manipulations affect conditions such as
light, temperature, gravity, etc. Most Manipulation spells are handled
as Success Tests, with hits determining the effect.

Mental Manipulations: For Mental Manipulation spells, the caster makes an Opposed Spellcasting + Magic Test against the target’s Willpower (+ Counterspelling, if available). If the caster scores more hits, she controls the target as noted in the spell description. Every (Force) Combat Turns, the victim may spend a Major Action to shake off the mental control. the victim rolls a Willpower (+ Counterspelling) Test; each hit reduces the Effect on the caster’s original Spellcasting Test. If the spellcaster’s Effect are reduced to 0, the spell no longer affects the target.

#### Mob Control (Mental, Area)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 2

the caster of this spell controls the physical actions of a target like a puppeteer pulling strings. the victim’s consciousness is unaffected, but the
caster controls the victim’s body. the target uses any skills or abilities at
the caster’s orders, but these tests suffer a  modifier equal to the
target’s Willpower because of the victim’s resistance to the caster’s commands. Controlling a target character requires the caster to spend a Simple
Action; when not directly controlled, the victim may act as normal.
Control Actions only affects a single target, Mob Control affects
any living targets within the area of effect. Victims of a Mob Control
may be manipulated individually (with separate Simple Actions) or
issued the same command as a group (with a single Minor Action).

#### Control Emotions (Mental)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2)

#### Mob Mood (Mental, Area)

as love, hate, fear, joy, sorrow, and so forth). the target believes the emotion
wholeheartedly, but not mindlessly. A target who acts in accordance with
the emotion (for example, fighting while filled with anger or hate) suffers
no penalty. If the target takes action not relevant to the emotion (trying
to drive while laughing hysterically), she suffers a –2  modifier
for the distraction. the caster may switch emotions with a Minor Action.
Control Emotions only affects a single target, Mob Mood affects
any living targets within the area of effect.

- Duration: I 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1

yard per minute in normal temperatures.

#### Ignite (Physical)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: P

the Ignite spell accelerates molecular motion in the target, causing it
to catch fire once the spell becomes permanent. the spellcaster must
achieve enough Effect to beat a threshold equal to the target’s Object
Resistance (p. 183). Once the target ignites, it burns normally until it
is consumed or extinguished.
Against living targets, treat Ignite as an Opposed Test pitting
Spellcasting + Magic vs. Stamina (+ Counterspelling). If successful,
Ignite wraps a living target in heat and flames once it has been made
permanent, causing (Force) boxes of Fire damage (p. 164) on the first
Combat Turn, and increasing by one box of damage each additional
turn. Resolve the damage at the end of each Combat Turn by making
a Damage Resistance Test using the victim’s Stamina + half Impact armor.
Ammo or explosives carried by a victim may go off. the gamemaster
should reduce the Force of the fire accordingly for extinguishing efforts

equal to the spell’s Force x net Spellcasting hits in yards per turn.
Objects flung into other things should be handled as a Ranged
Attack Test (see Fling), inflicting a number of boxes of Stun damage as
decided by the gamemaster (especially sharp or dangerous objects may
do Physical damage at the gamemaster’s discretion).

If the caster is attempting to levitate an item held by a living being,
make an Opposed Test between the spell’s Force x 2 and the holder’s
Strength + Stamina. the caster must have at least 1 net hit to levitate the
item away. If the caster is attempting to levitate an unwilling living
being, the Opposed Test uses the target’s Strength + Stamina. You can use
this spell to levitate yourself, if desired.

modifier due to problems of fine control. Even simple actions like picking up a coin may require an Agility Test, at the gamemaster’s discretion.
the caster can fight, pick a lock, or perform any other action,
using the magic fingers as if they were real hands. the spell can reach
any point the caster can see, and Clairvoyance or remote-viewing technology can be used to get a close-up of the scene as long as it is within
the caster’s normal line of sight. this spell comes in very handy for disarming bombs and handling other hazardous work from a safe distance.

#### Mana Barrier (Environmental, Area)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1

Mana Barrier creates an invisible barrier of magical energy with a Force
equal to the Effect scored. this barrier does not restrict living beings
or physical objects, but it does impede spirits, foci, dual beings, and
spells. If cast on the astral plane, it also impedes astral forms and restricts visibility. Any target of a spell that is on the other side of the
Mana Barrier receives a bonus to its spell resistance  equal to
the barrier’s Force. If the target had no resistance , but instead
has an Object Resistance threshold, increase the threshold by 1 for
every increment of 3 Force in the Mana Barrier (round up). See p. 194
for more information on mana barriers.

#### Petrify (Physical)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 2

Petrify transforms living tissue into stone-like calcium carbonate. the
caster must win an Opposed Test pitting her Spellcasting + Magic
against the target’s Stamina (+ Counterspelling). Additionally, the spell’s
Force must equal or exceed the target’s Stamina. Non-living material—
including clothing, gear, and cyberware—is not affected. the target
is not conscious while under the effects of this spell, and any damage
suffered by the stone-like form affects the target normally. While petrified, the subject has a barrier Armor rating equal to Stamina + Effect
(see Barriers).

#### Physical Barrier (Environmental, Area)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 3

Barrier spells create glowing, translucent force-fields with both 1 point
of Armor and Structure rating per hit (see Barriers). the caster
can form the barrier as a dome with a radius and height equal to the 
spell’s normal radius. the caster can also form a wall with a height and
length equal to the spell’s Force. the caster can adjust size of the barrier
the same as the radius of an area spell (p. 183).
Physical Barrier creates a physical wall. Anything the size of a molecule (or less) can pass through the barrier, including air or other gases.
Anything bigger treats the barrier as a normal physical wall. Attacks
directed through a barrier have a –1  visibility penalty. the
barrier does not impede spells. the barrier can be brought down by
physical attacks, but as long as it is sustained it regenerates damage
quickly—any reductions in Structure Rating are restored at the beginning of the next Combat Turn. If the barrier is penetrated, however,
it collapses and the spell ends. Physical Barrier cannot be used on the
astral plane.

#### Poltergeist (Environmental, Area)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 3

Poltergeist picks up all small objects (up to a kilogram in mass) within
the spell’s area and whirls them around in random patterns. this imposes a –2  visibility penalty in the area. the spell inflicts
2 boxes of Stun damage (resisted with Reaction + Impact armor) to
anyone in the area each Combat Turn, whacking them with flying
debris. Poltergeist may do more damage in cluttered environments, or
inflict Physical damage if the gamemaster feels the debris is sufficiently
dangerous (broken glass and nails, for example).

#### Shadow (Environmental, Area)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1

Shadow creates a globe of darkness with a radius equal to the spell’s
Force in yards. Every hit imposes a –1 die pool visibility modifier
against targets within the area (maximum –6).

#### Shapechange (Physical)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 2

#### (Critter) Form (Physical)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1

Shapechange transforms a voluntary subject into a normal (non-paranormal) critter, though the subject retains human consciousness. the
subject can only assume the form of a critter whose base Stamina rating
is 2 points greater or less than her own. Consult the Critters section,
p. 292, for the subject’s Physical attributes while in critter form. Add 1
to the critter’s Base attribute Ratings for every hit the caster generates.
Her Mental attributes remain unchanged.
this spell does not transform clothing and equipment. Magicians
in critter form can still cast spells, but cannot perform other tasks requiring speech.
Critter form works like the Shapechange spell, but only allows the
subject to change into a specific non-paranormal animal. Each critter
form is a different spell (Eagle Form, Wolf Form, and so on)

#### Turn to Goo (Physical)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 2

Turn to Goo transforms living tissue into a sticky, glue-like substance.
the caster must win an Opposed Test pitting her Spellcasting + Magic
against the target’s Stamina (+ Counterspelling). Additionally, the spell’s
Force must equal or exceed the target’s Stamina. Non-living material—
including clothing, gear, and cyberware—is not affected. the target
is not conscious while under the effects of this spell, and any damage
suffered by the gooey form affects the target normally. the goo has a
barrier Armor rating equal to Stamina + Effect.
