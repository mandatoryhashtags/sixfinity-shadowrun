## What is SIRE?

SIRE is a 3d6 TTRPG system created by CJ Schrum to be a generic system used to play any kind of TTRPG. It was influenced by his near thirty years of table top games in nearly every ruleset created. 

> I used to play FATE I liked a lot of things about FATE, I hated FATE dice mechanics. I played a lot of Cepheus, Traveller, Decipher Star Trek, ModernAGE, West End Games Star Wars, and Sixfinity so lets say I have a lot of experience with D6 in my hands. So I set out to create a fairly generic style RPG using 3D6 (I like the curve better than the standard distribution of 2D6). Allowing for Advanatage Roll 3D6 twice take highest, and Disadvantage Roll 3D6 twice take the lowest. They also have Edge Points they can spend.
> Combat is meant to be cinematic in style with a tactical flavor. Characters have Physical Health.

## Chapter 1: Character Creation 
{{Write a Definition}}

### Attributes

There are eight attributes and two special attributes.

---

**Physical Attributes**

---


**Body**

This represents the general sturdiness, integrity, and health of the individual. It sometimes is correlated to size—trolls tend to have high Body ratings— but this is not a perfect correlation, as dwarfs tend to have higher Body ratings than humans. Body’s uses include resisting damage and toxins.

**Agility**

Agility represents fine motor control—manual dexterity, flexibility, balance, and coordination. A character with a low Agility may be someone with an inner-ear problem, one leg that is shorter than the other, or a simple klutz. Higher Agility ratings may belong to charac- ters that are “natural” athletes.

**Reaction**

A character’s Reaction is, quite simply, her physical reflexes—how quickly she can react to a changing situation, and how well she can dodge the physical slings and arrows that shadowrunning brings. A character with a high Reaction is more likely to be on top of a situation and will be in a better position to react to danger, while low-Reaction characters will lag behind.

**Strength**

Strength denotes what a character’s muscles can do, including things such as raw lifiing power and running speed. Strength is some- what dependent on a character’s size and metatype. If your character is a 5’3” tall, 115-pound human girl, she’s unlikely to possess an un- augmented Strength attribute of 6. On the other hand, dwarfs have a muscle density that rivals that of reptiles. Characters with low Strength may be small, skinny, or slight, or simply too busy to work out. A high- Strength character may be tough and wiry, know how to use her body to her best advantage, work out every day, or simply be fraggin’ BIG.

---

***Mental Attributes**

**Charisma**

Charisma is a nebulous attribute. More than just looks, Charisma rep- resents a character’s personal aura, self-image, ego, willingness to find out what people want and give it to them, and ability to recognize what she can and can’t get out of people. A whiny demeanor, a me-first attitude, or an inability to read body language or subtle hints are just a few traits that can give a character low Charisma. A character with high Charisma might simply enjoy entertaining others, may excel at making friends and/or manipulating people, or may be all flash and fun with whomever it is today. A high-Charisma character might deliver jokes at the right moment, have a sexy way of carrying herself, or com- mand respect because her timing is always impeccable.

**Intuition**

Intuition covers “mental alertness”—the ability to take in and process information, to read a crowd, to assess a situation for danger or opportunity. A character with little Intuition may be unobservant, may rarely think things fully through, or could simply be “slow.” A character with a high Intuition is adept at making the best of a bad situation, knowing when to leave before an encounter escalates, noticing small clues, and working from instinct.

**Logic**

Logic represents a character’s memorizing ability and raw brain- power. It denotes how fast a character learns, how much she can re- member, and how well she can execute pre-planned sequences. A Logic-lacking character might get overwhelmed when confronted with a lot of details and may have a poor memory—especially for facts and figures. Characters with a high Logic rating will likely be excellent book-learners, able to deal with computer and magic theory with ease, and capable of building (and tearing down!) machinery and electronics. 


**Willpower**

Willpower keeps a character going when she wants to give up, or enables her to control her habits and emotions. Willpower determines whether or not a character is going to take charge of her life. A charac- ter with low Willpower might defer to other people when big decisions are being made, for example. A high-Willpower character is more as- sured and possesses a never-say-die streak. Such characters go down to the monowire because that’s exactly the fragging point. Willpower also represents a character’s cool under fire, her ability to resist intimida- tion and manipulation, and her resolve to stick to her guns when the
pressure is on.

---

**Special Attributes**

Please note Resonance is not used in Sixfinity if it is referenced ignore it.

**Magic**

Not all characters have this attribute; it is only for magic-using characters, who are generally referred to as Awakened characters. It measures their strength in channeling mana into spectacular effects.

**Edge**

This critical statistic measures the undefinable, putting it on tricky ground right at the outset. It is that combination of guts, risk, and heedless ignorance of danger and good sense that lets shadowrunners survive where others do not. Edge is detailed and important enough to have its own section


**Essence**

All characters have this attribute, starting at 6. It is a measure of how many augmentations characters can hold. The metahuman body can only contain so much ’ware before it loses the small spark that separates a living being from a machine. This attribute primarily exists due to the degrees of difference between biology and technology—it simply does not flow well through technology and becomes limited as your Essence declines (specifically, anytime your Essence goes below any whole integer, you lose a corresponding point of Magic or Resonance). Also, some magic, particularly healing magic, has less of an effect on you as you gain more augmentations. Finally, if your Essence ever reaches 0, you die


---


### Priority System

In Sixfinity character generation is based on the Priority System. The Priority System is a table with the following columns: Metatype, Attributes, Magic, Skills, and Resources. The rows are divided into Priority Levels ranging from Priority A to Priority E. Players assign a specific Priority Level for each of the columns to their character depending on their preferences. The values assigned must be different for each column (representing each aspect of the character), and there can be no duplications. For example, a character may not have Priority Level B for Magic and Priority B for Resources. The higher the Priority Level (A, B, etc.), the more valuable it is for the character. Characters use Experience later on to customize their characters even further.

The player begins the character-creation process by choosing their character’s metatype, or metatype. There are five distinct races within the core Sixfinity system, gamemasters are welcome to add or replace them: dwarfs, elves, humans, orcs, and fomori. Each metatype receives different racial advantages (and possibly disadvantages). Humans, for example, receive a higher rating in Edge (+1). Formions receive Thermographic Vision, +1 Reach (1 square), and Dermal Armor, but they also have the disadvantage of having their Lifestyle costs doubled to reflect the costs of adapting everything they use—especially their gear, to meet their massive physical requirements. Several metatype also receive physical or mental advantages/disadvantages to their attribute ratings (such as higher or lower natural attribute limits). When determining which metatype best fits the character concept they wish to play, the player should refer to the Metatype Attribute Table (below) and review the specific details for each metatype.

Once the player has selected the metatype they wish to play, they should review the Metatype column to determine which Priority Levels give them the best options for their character based on their preferred metatype and the special attribute points they need. The special attributes are Edge, and Magic; if you want your character to have a high rating in one or more of these areas, make sure you select a row with plenty of special attribute points.

Regardless of Priority all starting characters get 25 Experience to spend on their character to flesh them out, make then unique.

**Priority System Table**

Final Touches and Derived Stats.

### Derived Stats

#### Defense

Defense = 10 + (REACTION + INTUITION)

#### Attack Rating

When a character goes on the offensive, their chosen weapon has a combination of traits that determine it's overall effectiveness. This combination of stopping power, accuracy, and recoil compensation (for firearms) is captured in the Attack Rating. Characters add their Strength to the Attack Rating for melee weapons and the Attack Rating for unarmed combat is Strength + Reaction.

#### Defense Rating

This stat is an important part of combat, representing how well the character and their worn armor resist incoming attacks. It is a combination of Body, worn armor, and other effects, including augmentations and magic. This is used to calculate combat advantage and toughness

Defense Rating = Body + Armor

#### Physical Health

Physical Health = ([Body / 2] + 8) x4

This is your Physical Health. If it reach zero you are bleeding to death. You will start at 0 and lose 1 point per round you are not stabalized. You can go into the negative equal to your Overflow. 

For Example Jared is hit by a Shotgun for 13. Jared only had 10 Physical left. So Jared drops to 0 and is Incapacitated. The next round Jared drops to -1, Jared has a Body of 5 so he can bleed until he is at -10 once he ticks to -11 he is dead. 

> I will send you to a place where no amount of clapping will bring you back

#### Stun Health

Stun Health = ([Willpower / 2] + 8) x4

This is where Stun Damage is recorded. If it reaches 0 you start taking Physical Damage and you are at Disadvantage to most Tests until you take a Breather (see Healing). 

#### Overflow

This is how far into the Negatives you can go before you die. 

Overflow = Body X 2

#### Toughness

Toughness is a measure of how well prepared you are to take a blow, or to encourage it to miss you. It is used in virtually all combat situations. Some qualities and gear may affect this.

Toughness = [Defense Rating] /4 round up

If you have a Defense Rating of 11 that would be a Toughness of 3.

#### Movement

Base movement for any character is 10 + Agility in Yards.

#### Initiative

Initiative is used to determine who goes first in combat. Add your Reaction + Intuition for your base, then write how many Initiative Dice you have. You start with a default of 1; this may be increased by augmentations. It looks like this when written: 9 + 1D6

Initiative = Reaction + Intuition + 1D6

#### Edge Points

List your Edge Rating after character creation.

#### Composure (Willpower + Charisma)

When the stress is running hot, the gamemaster can call for a test to see if you keep your cool. The gamemaster sets the threshold, and the player makes the roll to see if they stay engaged or start freaking out. Note that repeated exposure to certain types of situations reduces the need for Composure tests in those situations

#### Judge Intentions (Willpower + Intuition)

Sometimes you just need a roll to get a read on someone. The Judge Intentions test is just that. Once you’ve had enough time to get a read on someone (as judged by the gamemaster), you can make a roll to help fill in your basic attitude and feelings toward the target. Just remember that a good part of Mr. Johnson’s training is dedicated to getting you to trust them when you shouldn’t.

#### Memory (Logic + Intuition)

Most of us don’t remember our lives with one hundred percent clarity. We’re influenced by the mood at the time we formed a memory, the current mood, the presence or absence of memorable stimuli, or even slight oddities in the details. Then you have the tricks our mind plays in distorting memories to make us the heroes of our own story, and things get really weird. When it’s time to make a withdrawal from the memory bank, the gamemaster sets a threshold based on the age and complexity of the information, and you can roll to determine whether or not you recall the information you want. It may be about remembering a face, recalling a critical piece of information, pulling up a detail from the past that will help you understand what’s happening in front of you right now, or some other mental feat.

#### Lift/Carry (Body + Willpower)

As any professional powerlifter or crossfit champ will tell you, it’s not all in the muscles. You need the will to persevere in order to pull that little extra bit for the big efforts. Whether it’s pulling a comrade out of danger or flipping a car to cover your getaway, this is going to be the roll when there’s a question on whether or not it can be done. Characters can lift `[(Strength x Strength) x 20]` pounds naturally; if they need to raise the weight over their head, the multiplier drops to 10. Making a Lift/Carry test increases your effective Strength by 1 per net hit. It also does 1 Stun damage, resisted by Body. The damage increase by +1 each combat round you continue holding or carrying the weight.

### Character Advancement

In this game you spend your experience you gain at the end of the sessions to increase your charatcer during downtimes. 

Raising attributes is based on what the modifier not the base score. So to increase your Strength that is +3 to +4

| Desired Effect                               | XP Cost         |

## Chapter 2: Metatype

### Humans (homo sapiens sapiens)
• Average height: 5'6
• Average weight: 140 pounds
• Ears: Rounded
• Known for: Average size; average build; freaking out about people who don’t meet their averages
• Racial qualities: Humans have no extra racial qualities.

As the majority of the sentient beings of the world, humans create existing definitions of “normal,” and then some of them set out to abuse those definitions as hard as they can. These humans know that they lack the pure physical strength and social cohesion of some of the other metatypes, so they shape the world in a way that keeps the individuals they don’t like from ever realizing what they can do, and what they can become. The side effect of this, of course, is that many humans are caught up in the demoralizing machinery that the ruling corporate class has assembled, because they don’t fit into this artificial average. They are grist for the mill, people to be chewed up and spat out in the name of greater wealth and power for the people at the top. Because they’re humans, and there are so many of them, who’s going to notice how they’re ground down, and who is going to miss them when they’re gone? The shadows are full of humans who could not find a way to be normal or average.

### Elves (homo sapiens nobilis)
- Average height: 1.9 meters
- Average weight: 80 kg
- Ears: Pointy
- Known for: Slender, lithe build; being attractive and knowing it
- Racial qualities: Elves have low-light vision

Perhaps the most infuriating thing about elves to the other metatypes is that you can resent them like hell, and they just won’t care. They have two prosperous nations—Tír na nÓg (formerly known as Ireland) and Tír Tairngire (in the western part of North America)—they have people in some of the most powerful positions in the world, and celebrities whose MeFeed hits are in the billions. They are envied, not looked down on. But plenty of elves know that this envy does not extend to every elf. If you’re an elf who is not rich, elegant, or graceful, you’re often viewed as a failure, someone who had all the gifts of life handed to them and somehow screwed them up. And it’s not just nonelves who hold this view. Never mind that you might have grown up poor, never mind what obstacles you had to face—people think you automatically had it easy because you’re an elf. But elf society is not easy to survive. The upper crust can be absolutely ruthless about enforcing their status quo, labeling those who don’t fit as malcontents and finding ways to cast them aside. The barrens of the major sprawls of the world have plenty of elves who were thrown out because they wouldn’t cave to what society wanted them to be. Their anger could burn the whole earth.

### Dwarfs (homo sapiens pumilionis)
Average height: 1.2 meters
- Average weight: 54 kg
- Ears: Slightly pointy
- Known for: Short size; stocky build; perseverance
- Racial qualities: Dwarfs have thermographic vision and toxin resistance.

Sixth World dwarfs are often accepted into mainstream society without being fully valued. The taller metatypes seem to be happiest when dwarfs fit the roles they have preconceived for them— sidekicks, drivers, mechanics, that sort of thing. It doesn’t help that their size helps them squeeze into vehicles that orks, humans, and elves might have difficulty with, ones that trolls couldn’t even consider using. Still, they get work and little direct hate. They’re treated nicely, but they can’t help but feel that they’re being, well, overlooked. Dwarfs across the globe are dedicated to showing that they cannot be ignored. Dwarf deckers, street samurai, covert ops specialists, faces, and more are popping up in the international shadows, and others underestimate them at their peril. The lack of heightened antipathy against dwarfs helped them assimilate in human communities better than other metatypes. This means that they do not have as many of their own enclaves as some of the other metatypes (it also doesn’t help that they don’t have access to whatever stream of revenue the elves tap into build their kingdoms). With the founding of the dwarf-centric Biloxi Technical Institute, southern Mississippi in the CAS is becoming a dwarf haven. What that will grow into and how that will shape the world is anyone’s guess.


### Orks (homo sapiens robustus)
- Average height: 1.9 meters
- Average weight: 128 kg
- Ears: Pointy- Known for: Big, powerful physique; tusks; constantly being seen as outsiders
- Racial qualities: Orks have low-light vision and the Built Tough (1) quality

Orks make people nervous, and people don’t like to be nervous. Their tusks, bone structure, and pointed ears mark them as something altogether else, and their strength and size clearly show the damage they could do. As humans have done for centuries, they address the thing they fear by pushing them aside, keeping orks from building collective strength, and crushing them with the sheer force of numbers. That approach works as long as you can keep fear stoked and have it immobilize the masses. Because if people can move past the fear and start to understand the deliberate injustice that has been forced on some groups, they separate themselves from society’s machine, and the number of people used to enforce oppression gets smaller. Oppressors aren’t especially good at developing new solutions to such problems— they usually just resort to oppressing harder. So while realization of the injustices they deal with is spreading, orks across the Sixth World are preparing for things to get worse so that they can survive and set about the work of making things better. They already have some enclaves carved out for themselves— Seattle’s Underground, Atlanta’s Sweetwater Creek, Dharavi in the Indian Union—and they hope those locales will be the starting points for societies that include orks instead of fearing them.


### Trolls (homo sapiens ingentis)
- Average height: 2.5 meters
- Average weight: 300 kg
- Ears: Slightly pointy, often hidden by horns
- Known for: Being so big, you guys. Just huge. And horns.
- Racial qualities: Trolls have thermographic vision, the Built Tough (2) quality, and dermal deposits (which provide +1 to trolls’ Defense Rating).

It’s not easy to live in a society where you look like the walking embodiment of everyone else’s nightmares. Being two to three times as large as everyone else doesn’t help much, either. It’s not a troll’s world, and most of the other residents of the world aren’t inclined to change that fact. Who wants to make space for imposing monsters? Trolls are going to have to force their way into a place in the world—of course, when they force their way in anywhere, they’re inevitably called vandals and destroyers. A significant number of trolls have looked at the way the deck is stacked against them and decided they don’t need to play the rest of the world’s game anymore. They’ll stand aside and watch the world burn—and maybe throw on an extra match every now and then. The Black Forest Troll Republic is one of the most important troll communities in the world, acting as a beacon and vision for what troll society can be while keeping a certain distance from everyone else. Whether they assimilate or build a higher wall is an open question. Trolls have the most difficult time adapting to other metatypes because their bodies are so different. It’s more than just the size and the horns— they have dermal deposits all over their bodies that make knobs, bumps, and other formations. They scrape up furniture and clothing, and make some people think twice about giving a troll a big bear hug. Especially since there are few people who can wrap their arms around a whole troll.




## Chapter 3: Contacts & Allies

A shadowrunner who goes it alone is often one
that winds up in a lonely, solitary grave. Experienced
shadowrunners build a network of people who can
provide the information and goods critical to their
work. Maybe it’s a bartender who knows the people
in their neighborhood, or an arms dealer who can get
the ammo that doesn’t flow through legal channels,
or a Lone Star officer who likes to shoot the breeze
about who just got arrested. These people and more
can be reached out to in times of need.

## Chapter 4: Rules

The rules center around rolling three six sided dice. One of those dice **must** be of a different color this dice is called the "The Effect Dice" this dice will add drama, excitement, and moments of unpredictability in the game. 

### How does it work?

Nearly everything is a TEST or CHECK. 

Result = 3D6 + Ability Modifier + Skill Rank

You compare this result to a Threshold (below)

### Thresholds
A Threshold is the minimum number needed to succeed at a task. Threshold Step is used very often in these rules. A threshold step is used instead of giving the Threshold Target (or TN in other games) to allow the Gamemaster to alter the Targets as they see fit for their game without needing to alter the writing in the rules to maintein balance.

For example if a character needs a `Biotech + Logic (2) test` in Sixfinity Standard rules they need to roll *at least* a 9 on 3D6. If a GM decided they wanted that to be a 10 they do not need to change anything just tell the character they succeeded or failed without having to make any adjustments to the rules. This is the same as using the word Simple but the Step makes it easier to explain to a player. This is inspired by a number of 80's games like Traveller, Gamma World, Shadowrun 1e where the target number on dice could change. This allows for some GM's who want to, to easily swap to a D20 and use 5/10/15/20/25 for their TN's and go looking for Dragons in Dungeons if they want.

If you are assining a test and the only thing that matters is their Effect on the roll feel free to make it a Step 1 test. 

| Difficulty | Step | Threshold Target |
| ---------- | ---- | ---------------- |
| Easy       | 1    | 6                |
| Simple     | 2    | 9                |
| Average    | 3    | 12               |
| Hard       | 4    | 18               |
| Very Hard  | 5-6  | 24               |
| Extreme    | 7-8  | 30               |


> Did I really make Sixfinity Dice Agnostic ... more or less yes as long as you know what you're doing. You could use a D20 (swingy), 3D6, 2d10, 2d12, 4d6, 5d4 even 2D6 or 1d12 if you made sure the curve made sense with the Skill Ratings. 




### Rolling 18
When you roll a nautral 18, you get another D6 to roll and add to your total it also adds to your Total and Effect Dice. This is the same as a Push the Limit Edge spend. 

Optionally you can recharge a **Spent** Edge.

#### Glitching

Also called a Botch. 

When you roll a natural 1 on the effect dice; this is called a glitch or a botch. As long as you still beat the Threshold provided you are able to get a success. However, something will happen that did not go according to plan this is ruled by the Gamemaster but some suggestions are things like gun jammed requiring a Minor A ction to clear it. We treat this as a "Yes but..." siutation.

What if you roll a natural 3? In that case you have a Critical Glitch. Critical Glitches can be quite bad it depends on the GM a common rule during combat is that the gun is so fouled up it takes a Major Action or it may be completely out of commission until you can make a Mechanics check to repair it. This is treated as a "No and..." situation. A roll of 3 always fails.


### Effect
This is where the game really takes off. As long as you succeeded at a Test you are considered to have an Effect of 1. In some cases (like combat) you need to know how well you did. In cases like this the Effect Dice result will tell you what your Effect is.

#### Net Effect

Net Effect is calculated after a roll. 

In a Success Test the GM rolls and Effect Dice. You compare your Effect Dice (total if you got more than one) with the Effect Dice of the GM. Subtract the lesser from the greater and the net result is the Net Effect. Minimum 1.

In an opposed test you compare the Effect Dice of both sides. Subtract the lesser dice number from the greater dice(s) number and the net result is the Net Effect which goes to whoever won. Minimum 1.

### Advantage and Disadvantage

Advantage: Roll 3d6 and keep the higher of the two rolls.

Disadvantage: Roll 3d6 keep the lower of the two rolls.


### Success Tests
In a Simple test, you roll `3D6 + Attribute + Skill`, and see if you meet total or beat a Threshold established by the gamemaster. The gamemaster establishes the Threshold based on the Threshold Guidelines and suggestions and guidelines established within the rules. If the the total is equal to or greater than the threshold, the action succeeds; in some occasions, the number of effect (the number on the Effect Dice) comes into play.

Written as `Attribute + Skill (Threshold Step)`

This is a very important thing to understand - these are written as THRESHOLD STEP. This allows the Gamemaster to alter the actual dice Thresholds as they see fit without changing how a test works.

### Opposed Tests

In an Opposed test, another character, object, device, or entity is actively (or passively) resisting your efforts, so you must exceed their effort to succeed. In an Opposed test, two parties roll their dice and compare the number to the totals. The one with the highest total wins. Ties typically go to the aggressor, though this may change if net effect are required to make a given effect. The difference between the higher number of effect and the lower number of effect are the net effect in these tests, and they are often applied to the action in some way— for example, in combat, net effect from the attacker are added to the Damage Value of their attack.

Written as `Attribute + Skill vs. Opposed Attribute + Skill` These are rolled for higher roll. Then calculate Net Effect winner Effect Dice - Loser Effect Dice minimum 1 Net Effect.

### Extended Tests

Simple and Opposed tests involve actions that are taken and resolved quickly, generally in the course of a few seconds. Extended tests take longer and are for more complicated activities, like repairing an automobile or building a backdoor into a Matrix host. Extended tests have a modifier and a threshold like Simple tests, but they threshold does not have to be met on a single roll (and often can’t be) as it is a threshold *step*. The player can make multiple rolls of the dice,until they have accumulated enough total (totaling the totals from all their rolls) to meet or beat the threshold. With each roll, a certain amount of time passes. This time is known as the interval, and it is listed as part of each Extended test. 

Written as: Extended `Engineering + Logic (9, 1 hour) test`

### Attribute Only Tests

The gamemaster decides when an attribute-only test is called for and what attributes to apply. Attribute-only tests pair two attributes together to form a modifier, although there may be some situations where only one attribute applies. Here are a few attribute-only pairings built to suit situations where no skill suffices.

**COMPOSURE (CHA + WIL)**


Some situations are tough to deal with, even for hardened runners. When a character is faced with an emotionally overwhelming situation there are only two choices. Stay and fight or turn into a quivering lump of goo. To find out which one happens, make a `Willpower + Charisma` Test. Take note that repeating similar situations over and again eventually eliminates the need to perform this test. Staring down a group of well-armed foes will be scary at first, but after a character does it a few times the fear gives way to instinct.

**JUDGE INTENTIONS (CHA + INT)**


Reading another person is also a matter of instinct. A character can use their instincts to guess at the intentions of another person or to gauge how much they can trust someone. Make an Opposed `Intuition + Charisma` Test against the target’s `Willpower + Charisma`. This is not an exact science. A successful test doesn’t mean the target will never betray you (intentions have been known to change), and deceptive characters can gain another’s confidence easily. This primarily serves as a benchmark or gut instinct about how much you can trust the person you are dealing with.

**LIFTING/CARRYING (BOD + STR)**


The baseline for lifting weight is 30 pounds per point of Strength. Anything more than that requires a `Strength + Body Test`. Each Effect increases the max weight lifted by 30 pounds. Lifting weight above your head, as with a clean & jerk, is more difficult. The baseline for lifting weight above the head is 10 pounds per point Strength. Each Effect on the Lifting Test increases the maximum weight you can lift by 10 pounds. Carrying weight is significantly different than lifting weight. Characters can carry Strength x 20 pounds in gear without effort. Additional weight requires a Lifting Test. Each Effect increases the maximum by 20 pounds. For more details on carrying gear, see Carrying Gear.

**MEMORY (LOG + WIL)**


While there are numerous mnemonic devices designed for remembering information, memory is not a skill. If a character needs to recall information make a `Logic + Willpower` Test.

Glitches can have a devastating effect on memory. A glitch means the character misremembers some portion of the information, such as order of numbers in a passcode. A critical glitch means the character has completely fooled himself into believing and thus remembering something that never actually happened.

**RESIST KNOCKDOWN (STR)**


When you take more damage in a single attack than your Physical Limit x 3 you must avoid being knocked prone. Do this with a `3D6 + STR VS Damage Taken or 10 whichever is higher` success means you stay on your feet, failure you are knocked prone. If you take 30 damage in a single attack you are automatically knocked down regardless of the roll. 

**TOXIN RESISTANCE TEST (BOD + WIL)**


`Body + Willpower + the rating of any protective gear/systems`; each Effect reduces the toxin’s Power by 1 point. If the Power is reduced to zero, the toxic substance takes no effect; otherwise, apply the effect depending on the remaining Power level.

### Edge Points

Edge is a character’s luck, the favor of the gods, that unexplainable factor that allows her to beat the odds. A character’s Edge attribute represents the number of Edge points a character has to spend during gameplay. Edge points can be used for a wide range of benfits, each noted below. Edge points that are spent are temporarily unavailable (see Regaining Edge, below)—luck will only take you so far. Note that a character’s Edge attribute never actually changes, even when Edge points are spent, unless the character permanently burns Edge (see Burning Edge)

Humans can have 7 **maximum** courage, other metatype the **maximum** is 6 without the Lucky Quality. 

Spent Edge refreshes every game session. Or whenever the GM says it does.

On a long rest you get 1 Edge back.

**Optional Rule:** You can refresh a point of Edge on a Critical Success as long as no Edge was spent on that test.

Burnt Edge is gone. You have to buy more with Experience.

#### Spending Edge 

A character can only spend Edge points on her own actions; she cannot spend it on behalf of others (except when engaged in a “teamwork” test). You can only use Edge once on any test/roll or challenge. If you spent a point of Edge for extra dice and rolled a critical glitch anyway, for example, you cannot use Edge to negate that critical glitch since you have already applied Edge to that test.

Spending Edge can do the following, players choice:

- Push the Limit: Roll an additional Effect Dice and add it to your Total and Effect Dice
- Blitz!: Spend 1 Edge and get your Edge Rating in Bonus Edge to spend on this test.
- Seize the Initiative: Jump to the top of the initiative order. A character cannot both Blitz and Seize the Initiative in the same combat round.
- Dead Man’s Trigger: When reduced to 0 Physical Health or about to die, you immediately regain half your Physical Health. This can only be used once per Breather or Long Rest (5 minutes / 6 hours).
- Close Call: Either negate the effects of one glitch or turn a critical glitch into a glitch.

#### Burning Edge

In certain drastic situations, even spending Edge may not be enough. A character can choose to burn a point of Edge permanently reducing his Edge attribute by 1 for one of the following effects:

- Crits and Things: Burn 1 Edge to get +10 Bonus Edge to spend immediately. This breaks the rule of no more than 7 Bonus Edge.
- Not Dead Yet: When facing death you somehow survive. You still take all the negative effects of what happened such as lost limbs, you are just not dead. You are not dying either, you are stable.

#### Bonus Edge

This comes up in some situations. Bonus edge can be spent in one of two ways. It can buy +1 per point on your dice total, or it can buy 1 Effect for every 2.

For example in Combat:

Oda is attacking an Eye-Fiver. Here we compare the Attack Rating of the Ares Predator VI (8) to the Defense Rating of the Eye-Fiver (4; Body 3, + 1 for leathers) and see that Oda has a difference of **4 or more greater**, giving Oda one bonus Edge. 

Next, we check out the situation. It’s nighttime in a
dimly lit alley because Oda wanted to get them all bunched together and take advantage of the low-light vision on his cybereyes, which the gangers don’t have. This gives a second bonus Edge to Oda. 

Finally, we look at any other elements that might help either side. None are present, so the process moves on and Oda has 2 Bonus Edge he can spend to get 1 Effect or +2 on his roll total.



### Individual Rule Sections

These sections are referenced in other locations in the book for how something works. This is the central repository for this information instead of scattering it all over the book in Combat, Equipment, etc. 

#### Direct Neural Interface or DNI

A direct neural interface, or DNI, connects your brain to electronic devices. Direct neural interface (along with a sim module) is required for VR use, but DNI is also useful for AR in that you don’t need any additional gear like earbuds or an image link to see or hear augmented reality objects. How do you sign up? You get DNI by wearing trodes, or having an implanted datajack, commlink, or cyberdeck. And if you’re using a sim module along with your DNI, you can get a sort of “super AR mode” where you can also feel, smell, and taste your AR experience.

#### Grenades

When throwing a grenade, choose a location as a target. Use a Throw Weapon Minor Action and make a Throwing Weapons + Agility [Physical] (Threshold 18) Test modified for range and all the usual conditions. Success means the grenade lands right where you wanted. If you don’t meet the Threshold, the grenade scatters. The gamemaster determines scatter by consulting the Scatter Table (Determine Scatter). Hitting the Threshold on the test means no scatter, but it is still possible to hit the target if the scatter roll is low and the thrower got some Effect (see Determine Scatter). This all goes back to the old saying: “Close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades.”

Grenades are small, self-contained explosive or gasdelivery packages. They may come with a built-in timer to detonate after a pre-set amount of time (usually three seconds), a motion-sensor set to detonate on impact, or a wireless link set to detonate upon remote command. The type of detonation device determines the special rules and timing of grenade explosions.

Built-in Timer: This detonation method uses the attacker’s Initiative Score as the determining factor for detonation. The grenade is thrown during the character’s Action Phase and detonates in the next Combat Turn on the Initiative Score in which it was thrown minus 10, regardless of any additional changes to the thrower’s Initiative Score.

Motion Sensor: Grenades using a motion sensor are extremely dangerous. Once armed (about a second after the sensor is activated) the grenade explodes after any sudden stop or change in direction, meaning hitting the wall, floor, or target. This method uses the standard Ranged Attack rules but adds an extra step if it misses the target (no net Effect on the attack roll). After a failed attack roll, the thrower must roll for scatter and the grenade scatters the full amount before exploding immediately. A glitch on the attack roll means the grenade does not detonate on initial impact but instead doubles the scatter distance and explodes. A Critical Glitch means the thrower waited too long, and the throw sets off the grenade. The grenade detonates immediately, affecting the attacker and those around him. (Warned you it was dangerous.)

Wireless Link: This is the safest way to throw a grenade in some aspects, but it also comes with some risk and effort. The thrower (or anyone else who has a mark on the grenade) can detonate it by a wireless link. This requires the attacker to have a direct neural interface to the linked device and use the Change Wireless Device Mode Free Action. This method also reduces scatter. Without a DNI the attacker must use the Change Linked Device Mode Minor Action in their next or any of their subsequent Action Phases to detonate the grenade and scatter is not reduced.

##### Determine Scatter

If the attacker misses their intended landing spot, the gamemaster must determine the projectile’s scatter. The gamemaster determines the direction of the scatter by rolling 2D6 and consulting the Scatter Diagram. The 7 arrow indicates the direction of the launch, so a result of 7 means the projectile continued on past the target, while a result of 12 or 2 means the projectile scatters back in the direction of the attacker. Having determined the direction of the scatter, the gamemaster calculates the distance. The Scatter Table indicates a number of dice rolled based on the projectile, which is reduced by the number of Effect the attacker rolled. This is used to determine the final scatter distance. If the scatter distance is reduced to 0 or less, the projectile hits the target exactly. (Note that additional Effect do not add to Damage Values).

| Roll | Direction from Target |
| ---- | --------------------- |
| 2,12 | 6 oclock, south       |
| 3    | 8 oclock, SW          |
| 4    | 9 oclock, W           |
| 5    | 10 oclock,            |
| 6    | 11 oclock, NW         |
| 7    | 12 oclock, N          |
| 8    | 1 oclock, NE          |
| 9    | 2 oclock              |
| 10   | 3 oclock, E           |
| 11   | 5 oclock, SE          |


**Scatter Table**


| Type                | Scatter              |
| ------------------- | -------------------- |
| Standard Grenade    | (1D6 – Effect) yards |
| Aerodynamic Grenade | (2D6 – Effect) yards |
| Grenade Launcher    | (3D6 – Effect) yards |
| Missile Launcher    | (4D6 – Effect) yards |
| Rocket Launcher     | (5D6 – Effect) yards |

#### Grenade Launchers, Rockets, & Missiles

Occasionally, characters get their hands on military- grade hardware, like grenade launchers, missiles, and rocket launchers. Resolving a launched grenade, rocket, or missile attack is a two-step process. The first step determines where the projectile ends up in relation to the target (see Determine Scatter). The second step resolves the effect of the projectile’s explosion.

When you fire a grenade, rocket, or missile you use a Attack Major Action and roll a Heavy Weapons + Agility [Accuracy] (Threshold 18) Test modified for range and all the usual conditions. Success means the launched weapon hits right where you wanted. If you don’t meet the Threshold, the projectile scatters. The gamemaster determines scatter by consulting the Scatter Table.

#### Blast Effects

Grenades, rockets, and missiles are area-effect weapons, meaning that their blast affects a given area and any targets within it. The farther away the target is from the explosive’s final location—the blast point—the less damage it takes, because distance reduces the effect of an explosive’s blast. Different grenade, rocket, and missile types lose blast effect at different rates. Consult the Grenades/ Rockets/Missiles Table to find the projectile’s Damage Code and Damage Value reduction rate.

#### TOXINS, DRUGS, AND BTLS

The Sixth World is a vicious place; it seems like something is always trying to do you harm. It’s not always a physical weapon, either. Sometimes it’s a fragging molecule or simsense program. Toxins come in a stunning array of forms in Shadowrun, some of them weaponized, some of them recreational. This section will deal with them. It opens with those toxins used primarily as weapons against the characters. Following those come the more recreational pharmaceuticals and their technological cousins. Then we finish up with rules and guidelines for substance abuse and addiction.

##### TOXINS

Knockout drugs. Truth serum. Nerve gas. All of these are examples of toxins, a catch-all term for a substance that’s mostly meant for use as a weapon, as opposed to recreation. Each substance has several attribute ratings.

**Vector**


This shows how the toxin is delivered to the target.

Contact toxins can be solid, liquid, or gaseous. They attack the victim through the skin. These toxins, if in liquid form, can be coated on a weapon. In this case, they can be applied with a successful Melee Attack, whether the attack causes damage or not. A chemical seal offers complete protection from this vector, unless it’s breached. Chemical protection gives a modifier equal to its rating to the target’s Toxin Resistance Test.

Ingestion toxins must be eaten by the victim. They can be solids or liquids. Since they must be eaten, they generally take longer to have an effect. Toxin extractor bioware provides a modifier equal to the rating of the augmentation to resist ingested and other toxins.

Inhalation toxins are applied as an aerosol spray or gas, and they must be breathed in by the target. Gas masks, chemical seals, and active internal air tanks provide immunity to inhalation toxins. Chemical protection gives bonus modifier to the Toxin Resistance Test equal to its rating.

Injection toxins must get into the target’s bloodstream, whether through a dart, hypodermic needle, or a cut. These can also be used to coat an edged melee weapon. They are applied to the target with a successful melee attack that causes damage.

**Speed**


This determines how quickly the victim suffers the toxin’s Effect. These effects are always applied at the end of a Combat Turn.




## Chapter 5: Qualities

### Positive Qualities
These provide bonuses in role playing situations, situational modifiers, and permanent effects. 


#### Ambidextrous

Cost: 4 XP

The character can use and handle objects equally well with both hands. The character does not suffer disadvantage for using an off-hand weapon. When using two weapons at once, however, the character must still get disadvantage on the off hand attack. 

#### Analytical Mind

Cost: 5

Analytical Mind describes the uncanny ability to logically analyze information, deduce solutions to problems, or separate vital information from distractions and noise. It’s useful in cracking cyphers, solving puzzles, figuring out traps, and sifting through data. This quality gives the character a Advantage to any Mental Tests involving pattern recognition, evidence analysis, clue hunting, or solving puzzles. This quality also reduces the time it takes the character to solve a problem by half.

#### Animal Empathy

Cost: 5 XP

A character with Animal Empathy has an intuitive sense for understanding and handling animals of all kinds.

Effect: You gain a Advantage on all Tests made to influence, calm, train, guide, or control animals (this includes riding, driving, or directing them).

#### Aptitude

Cost: 14 XP

This quality is how you become even better than the best in the world. The standard limit for skills is 6. Every so often, there is a character who can exceed limitations and be truly exceptional in a particular skill. With this particular quality, the character can have one skill rated at 7 at character creation, and may eventually build that skill up to rating 7. Characters may only take the Aptitude quality once.

#### Astral Chameleon

Cost: 10 XP

With the Astral Chameleon quality, the character’s astral signature blends into the background of astral space and is difficult to detect. All signatures left by the character last only half as long as other astral signatures. Any individuals assensing astral signatures left behind by a character with this quality receive a –2 modifier for the Assensing Test. Only characters with a Magic rating and capable of leaving astral signatures may have this quality.

#### Bilingual 

Cost: 5 XP

A character with this quality reads, writes, and speaks a second language fluently. They can list a second language as a native tongue (see Language Skills). **This quality can only be acquired at character creation**; selecting it gives the character a second free language skill during Step Five: Purchase Active, Knowledge, and Language Skills.

#### Blandness

Cost: 8 XP

This character blends into a crowd; he’s seldom noticed and easily forgotten. He is unremarkable in every aspect of physical appearance. Anyone attempting to describe the character cannot come up with anything more precise than “average height, average build, average hair, etc.” Increase the {Threshold} tier for anyone to recall specific details about the character by 1. This means a Memory Test with a difficulty of Average ({Threshold} 10) becomes a Hard test ({Threshold} 15).

Individuals attempting to shadow or physically locate a character with the Blandness quality in a populated setting receive a –2 modifier on all tests related to their search. The same penalty applies if they’re asking around about the person based on the individual’s physical appearance. If the character acquires any visible tattoos, scars, or other distinguishing features, the bonuses from the Blandness quality go away until the distinctive features are removed from the character’s appearance.

In certain circumstances and specific situations, the gamemaster may determine that Blandness does not apply. For example, a Troll with the Blandness quality still towers head and shoulders over a crowd of humans and so still stands out, no matter how average they dress. The character only regains his bonus by leaving the situation where he stands out.

#### Catlike

Cost: 7 XP

A character with the Catlike quality is gifted with an uncanny elegance, a stealthy gait, and an almost preternatural ability to move without making a sound.

They also claim they land on their feet when dropped, though they tend not to let people test this. This quality adds a Advantage to Sneaking skill tests.

#### Codeslinger

Cost: 10 XP

You are exceptionally skilled at navigating the Net and executing digital intrusions.

Effect: You gain a Advantage on all Tests involving hacking, intrusion, or similar Net-based actions.

Restriction: This Quality may only be taken once.

#### Double Jointed

Cost: 6 XP

Your joints are unusually flexible, allowing you to bend and contort your body into extreme positions.

Effect: You gain a Advantage on all Sleight of Hand Tests when performing escape artist actions, such as slipping out of cuffs, ropes, or other restraints.

GM Discretion: You may also attempt to squeeze into cramped or narrow spaces where a less limber character could not fit.


#### Exceptional Attribute

Cost: 14 XP

Some individuals push beyond the natural limits of their metatype, embodying rare physical or mental potential.

Effect: Choose one Attribute. Your natural maximum for that Attribute increases by +1 above your species’ normal maximum.

Example: A Human with Exceptional Attribute could raise one Attribute to 7 instead of the usual maximum of 6.

Augmented Maximum: The augmented maximum for that Attribute also increases by +1.

Restriction: This Quality may only be taken once.


#### First Impression

Cost: 11 XP

You have a natural knack for sliding into new places and situations as if you belong there.

Effect: You gain a Advantage on all Social Tests made during your first interaction in a new environment—whether infiltrating a group, meeting contacts in a new city, or joining a fresh team.

Limitation: The bonus only applies during the initial encounter. Subsequent meetings and interactions are unaffected.



#### Focused Concentration

Cost: 4 XP (Maxium 6 Rating)

A magician with the Focused Concentration quality has the discipline to manipulate mana more precisely than otherwise possible. This precision reduces stress to the magician. She is able to sustain one spell form with a force/level equal to her Focused Concentration rating without suffering any penalties. For example, a magician with Focused Concentration rating 3 may sustain a Force 3 Armor spell without taking the negative modifier for sustaining a spell. Sustaining any additional spells incurs the standard –2 modifier per spell sustained to Fatigue checks. This quality may only be taken by magician characters that are able to cast spells.

#### Gearhead

Cost: 11 XP

The Gearhead is who you look for when it’s time to stomp on the gas and move. She’s a natural-born driver or pilot. When she’s at the wheel/stick/controls of a vehicle or drone, she has an intuitive understanding of its limitations and its capabilities and is able to coax whatever machine she’s controlling to perform at its best. During vehicle or chase combat, a Gearhead can increase the Speed of her vehicle or drone by 20 percent or increase the Handling modifier by +1 (player’s choice). She also receives a Advantage when attempting difficult maneuvers or stunts in the vehicle. This bonus lasts for 1D6 minutes.

The player can choose to make this bonus last up to an additional 1D6 minutes if she wants. Doing so pushes the vehicle or drone well beyond its design limits and risks catastrophic damage. For each minute the character pushes the vehicle past its initial bonus period, the vehicle automatically takes one point of stress damage (unresisted)

#### Guts

Cost: 10 XP

When a bug spirit with dripping mandibles comes calling, the character with Guts is the one most likely to stand and fight instead of freaking the hell out. Guts gives a character a Advantage on tests to resist fear and intimidation, including magically induced fear from spells or critter powers.

#### High Pain Tolerance

Cost: 7 XP per rating (max rating 3)

Your Overflow is increased by 1 per rating.

Restriction: Maximum rating is 3.

#### Human Looking

Cost: 5 XP

Some non-humans can pass for human in most day-to-day situations. Their appearance, mannerisms, and presence blend well enough that most people simply assume they are baseline human.

Effect: Human NPCs treat you with a neutral baseline attitude when making Social Tests, unless given a reason to react otherwise.

Complications: You may suffer increased hostility from non-human NPCs who resent humans—or who think you’re “trying too hard” to look like one.

Restriction: Only Elves, Dwarves, and Orcs may take this Quality.

#### Indomitable

Cost: 8 XP Per rating (Max 3)

Bodies and minds have limits, but some people have the will to push right through those boundaries. For each level of Indomitable, a character receives a +1 increase to an Inherent limit of his choice (Mental, Physical, or Social). He can take up to three levels and can apply them in any way he chooses (+3 to one Inherent Limit, for example; or +2 to one Inherent and +1 to another; or +1 to all three).


#### Lucky

Cost: 12 XP

Some individuals have an indomitable spirit that pushes beyond the limits of their metatype.

Effect: Your Edge Attribute maximum increases by +1 above your species’ normal limit.

Example: A Human with Exceptional Edge could raise Edge to 8 instead of the usual maximum of 7.

Advancement: This Quality does not grant an immediate increase to Edge; it only raises the cap. The Experience cost for raising the Attribute must still be paid through normal advancement.

Restriction: This Quality may only be taken once.


#### Magic Resistance

Cost: 6 XP per rating (max rating 4)

You have an innate resistance to magical effects, making it harder for spells to take hold—whether harmful or helpful.

Effect: For every 6 XP spent, you gain a +1 bonus on all Spell Resistance Tests. A magically resistant character cannot choose
to lower his magical resistance; it affects all spells and magical effects, good or bad. A character with Magic Resistance is never a willing subject for spells that require a voluntary subject; such spells automatically fail when used on magic resistant characters.

Limitation: This resistance applies to all spells, even beneficial ones such as Heal.

Scaling: This Quality may be taken multiple times, increasing your modifier by +1 for each purchase (up to the maximum of 4).

#### Natural Athlete

Cost: 7 XP

A character with this quality has an innate combination of physical fitness, spatial awareness, and natural athletic or gymnastic talent. While the character may not be a world-class athlete and may require training to achieve peak performance, he is in prime physical shape for his size and weight class. The Natural Athlete adds a Advantage for Running and Gymnastics skill tests.

#### Natural Immunity

Cost: 4 XP or 10 XP

You have an innate or developed resistance to a specific toxin or disease.

Effect:

4 XP: You are completely immune to one natural disease or toxin.

10 XP: You are completely immune to one synthetic (artificially engineered) disease or toxin.

Limitations:

This Quality does not apply to magically based diseases or toxins (such as lycanthropy).

The chosen disease, drug, or poison must be something your character could reasonably have been exposed to. The player and GM must agree on the specific agent.

Exposure: You may safely ingest or be exposed to one dose every (12 – Body) hours with no ill effects. If more than one dose is taken during that period, you suffer normal damage but your recovery time is halved.

Contagion: Immunity does not make you non-contagious. Characters immune to a disease can still carry and transmit it to others, even without symptoms.


#### Photographic Memory

Cost: 6 XP

A character with Photographic Memory can instantly recall facts, dates, numbers, or anything else he has seen or heard. The character gains a Advantage to all Memory Tests



#### Quick Healer

Cost: 3 XP

A Quick Healer recovers from damage more quickly than other characters. The character receives a Advantage to all Healing Tests made on/for/by him, including magical healing.


#### Resistance to Damage

Cost: 8 XP

A character with resistance chooses a *special* type of damage (not Impact or Ballistic) such as Fire, or Poison and gains resistance to that damage. Suffering half-damage from that source. This can only be taken once. 

#### Vigor

Cost: 9 XP per rating (Max 3)

Each time this is taken you increase your Toughness by 1 up to a Max of 3

#### Will To Live

Cost: 5 XP per rating (max 3)

This character can go into the negatives an additional point per rating up to the maximum of 3 when dying. Normally a character can only go into the negative equal to their Body.

### Negative Qualities



#### Addiction

Bonus: 4 to 25 XP

A character with the Addiction flaw is addicted to alcohol, drugs, or a similar substance with a detrimental effect on the character’s health (note that nicotine, caffeine, and sugar do not count). The value of this flaw depends on how severe the addiction is: Mild, Moderate, Severe, or Burnout. 

Mild (4 XP): the addiction is omnipresent but not blatant or intrusive; it may not even be recognized or acknowledged. At this stage it is easier to seek help, but very few recognize their addiction as something needing help at this stage. Addicts experience cravings at least once a week (if not every few days), but can ignore them if necessary without too much difficulty. The addict suffers a –2 modifier to Willpower and/or Stamina Tests to resist the craving.

Moderate (9 XP): the addiction at this stage is marked and  difficult to overcome. Addicts experience cravings at least once a day (if not more), and they are more difficult to ignore. The addict suffers a –4 modifier to Willpower and/or Stamina Tests to resist the craving.

Severe (20 XP): the addiction is out of control. The addict experiences constant cravings (at least twice a day), suffering a –6 modifier to Willpower and/or Stamina Tests to keep from giving in.

Burnout (25 XP): this is the same as a Severe addiction, except the addict has been in this state for some time and is experiencing the tell-tale signs of habitual use on his body. The character is always under the Exhausted condition. If the character does not kick the habit soon, he will continue to suffer advancing Fatigue at a rate determined by the gamemaster until he dies

#### Allergy

Bonus: Below

| Condition | Value in XP | Description                                                                                                 |
| --------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Uncommon  | 2           | The substance or condition is rare for the local environment. Example Silver,Gold                           |
| Common    | 7           | The substance or condition is common for the local environment. Examples Sunlight, plastic.                 |
| Mild      | 3           | Symptoms are discomforting and distracting.  –2 modifier to all tests made while experiencing the symptoms. |
| Moderate  | 8           | Contact with the allergen produces intense pain. –4 to all tests made while experiencing the symptoms       |
| Severe    | 13          | As Moderate but Vulnerable to weapons that do this damage                                                   |

A character with the Allergy flaw is allergic to a substance or condition. The value of this flaw depends on two factors. 

First, determine whether the substance or condition is Uncommon (2 XP) or Common (7 XP). then determine the severity of the symptoms: Mild (3 XP), Moderate (8 XP), or Severe (13 XP). Add the appropriate point values to find the final value. For example, the value of an Uncommon Moderate Allergy is 10 (2 + 8) points. The Allergy Table above gives descriptions of conditions and severity.

#### Astral Beacon

Bonus: 10 XP

The astral signature of a character with the Astral Beacon quality is like, well, a beacon—highly visible on the astral plane. The signature also lasts twice as long as it would without the Astral Beacon quality and others assensing it receive advantage to their Assensing Test for gathering information about it. Only characters with a Magic rating may take this quality.

#### Bad Luck

Bonus: 12 XP

This character is cursed—his own luck often turns against him. Whenever this character uses Edge, roll 1D6. On a result of 1, the Edge is spent, but it has the exact opposite effect intended. For example, if a character hopes to gain a reroll dice to take the higher option, instead he takes the lower option. If a character spends Edge to go first in an Initiative, he ends up going last. If a character spent Edge to negate a glitch, Bad Luck turns it into a critical glitch.

#### Codeblock

Bonus: 10 XP

The character is hopeless at actions with computers. Anytime they interact with the Net or a computer they get a Disadvantage to their rolls. 

#### Combat paralysis

Bonus: 12 XP

A character with Combat Paralysis freezes in combat situations. On the character’s first Initiative Test in combat, the character
rolls Initiative with disadvantage. On the second and subsequent Initiative Tests, however, the character rolls his normal Initiative. The character also receives a –3 modifier on Surprise Tests.

#### Gremlins

Bonus: 4 XP per rating (max rating 4)

Characters with the Gremlins flaw never seem to get along with technology. Devices malfunction inexplicably in the character’s hands, software constantly crashes whenever he uses it, components become unusually fragile at his touch, and wireless links suffer faltering connections and odd interference.

For every 4 XP gained in this flaw, increase the number of rolled 1s required to get a glitch (normally 3) by 1 whenever the character is attempting to use a moderately sophisticated device (late 20th century technology or later). 

For example, a character with a Gremlins Rating 2 (10 XP) would trigger a glitch if five or more 1s result from a test. The gamemaster may also require the character to make a test for operations that would otherwise succeed automatically, simply to see whether or not a glitch occurs.

When describing the effects of a Gremlin-induced glitch, gamemasters should play up the notion of a particularly weird mechanical or electronic malfunction. For example, if a Gremlin-plagued character glitches while shooting a pistol, the clip might inexplicably fall out of the gun, or the slide might jump off the rails and go flying into the distance. 

Note that Gremlins is a Negative quality—its effects should be hindering to the character (and entertaining to others). Gremlins should not be used as an “offensive ability,” where a character causes his opponent’s high-tech toys to fall apart merely by touching them.

Consider Gremlins to be a curse on the character—if he wants the technology to fail, then it should be more likely not to. this effect only applies to external equipment.

#### Incompetent

Bonus: 5 XP

A character who is Incompetent possesses a total lack of knowledge or ability with a certain Active skill. If this quality is taken, the player must specify an Active skill in which the character is Incompetent. Incompetent may not be applied to Language or Knowledge skills.

The character is treated as having a skill level of “unaware” for that particular skill. In some cases, a Success Test may be required to perform certain tasks that most people take for granted. Characters may not possess that skill, nor may they default on it. Gamemasters are free to reject any choices that would prove irrelevant or exploitative in actual play.

Incompetent may be purchased more than once, choosing a separate skill each time.

#### Loss of Confidence

Bonus: 10 XP

The Loss of Confidence quality means something has caused the character to lose confidence in himself and one of his abilities. Though a skilled hacker, he failed to hack into a Starbucks host, or despite high Agility, he glitched an easy Climbing Test and fell into a dumpster— whatever the reason, he now doubts himself and his abilities. In tests involving the affected skill, the character suffers a –2 modifier. If the character has a specialization with the skill, the character cannot use that specialization while suffering a loss of confidence.

The skill chosen for the character to have a Loss of Confidence must be one that the character prides himself in and has invested in building. Only skills with a rating 4 or higher may suffer the Loss of Confidence quality. Edge may not be used for tests involving this skill when the character is suffering Loss of Confidence.

#### Low Pain Threshold

Bonus: 9 XP

Your Overflow is reduced by 1 (minimum 0).



#### Uncouth

Bonus: 14 XP

Uncouth characters are antisocial or sociopathic and have a difficult time interacting with others. The cost for learning or improving Social skills is twice normal for Uncouth characters (including at character creation), and they may never take Aptitude in a Social skill.

Additionally, Uncouth characters are treated as “unaware” in any Social skills that they do not possess at Rating 1 or higher. The gamemaster may require the character to make Success Tests for social situations that normal people would have no problems with.

#### Uneducated

Bonus: 8 XP

An Uneducated character has grown up far away from the modern world and is thus
ignorant of modern society in general, possessing only a rudimentary knowledge of reading,
writing, and arithmetic. this is quality is fitting for characters who grew up in primitive societies or back-to-the-land anti-technological communes (for example, Amazonian primitives, Luddite collectives). This quality also applies to certain sentient creatures that have developed their own primitive society.

Characters with the Uneducated quality are considered “unaware” in Knowledge skills they do not possess, and they may not default on skill tests for those skills. The gamemaster may also require the character to make Success Tests for ordinary tasks that the typical person takes for granted. Additionally, the Experience cost for learning new skills or improving existing ones in these categories is twice normal (including at character creation), and the character may never take Aptitude in one of these skills.

#### Unsteady Hands

Bonus: 7 XP

A character with Unsteady Hands has mild shakes that affect the dexterity and finesse in his hands. The character suffers a –2 modifier for all Agility-based tests when symptoms manifest themselves. The condition could be physiological (an untreated genetic disorder or damaged nerves, for example), caused by psychological trauma, or even be symptomatic of age. Certain augmentations or medications can mask these symptoms under normal circumstances. Under more stressful situations in the course of the run, there is a chance the Unsteady Hands condition can reappear. The character makes an Agility + Body ({Threshold} 20) Test following a stressful encounter (combat, for example). A successful test means the character does not experience the symptoms of this condition (this time). A failed test causes the difficulties associated with unsteady hands to re-emerge, and they remain with the character for the remainder of the run.

#### Tracked (Layered)

Bonus: 5 or 25 XP

There are four levels of tracking. They have a record of some sort making them easily tracked.

- National: At the 5 XP level, the character has what is called Nationally Tacked. They have done something to get on the National Tracking list. The government of the country tracking you keeps loose tabs on your activities. 
- Criminal Record: At the 10 XP level the character has a Criminal Record. At some point in his life, the character was arrested and served time for a felony-level offense and was branded a criminal for the rest of his life. He is legally required to alert authorities of his travel and whereabouts at all times; failure to do so is a felony and can lead to re-incarceration. He is shunned by law-abiding society.
- Corporate Tracked: At the 15 XP level the character works for, worked for, or has had dealings with one of the majoe mega-corporations. This corporation keeps close tabs on you, your travel, transactions etc. Corporations do not have the adhere to privacy laws and can be quite overbearing in their tracking, it will be difficult to ever hide anything from them.
- Corporate Warrant: At the 25 XP level this character is actively wanted by a Megacorporation. They have few limits, near unlimited resources and never forget anything.

#### Vulnerability

Bonus: 10 XP

This character is Vulnerable to a type of special damage (not impact or ballistic) such as Fire or Cold. 

#### Weak Immune System

Bonus: 5 XP or 10 XP

This character is at Disadvantage on certain tests. For 5 XP they are at disadvantage to Stamina tests versus Disease. For 10 XP they are disadvantage on tests versus Poisons and Toxins as well as other hazards like Radiation. 




## Chapter 6: Skills

> Note Sixfinity does not use Skill Groups

Base skills are the fundamental skills in Sixfinity. Whereas attributes represent an individual’s inherent capacities, skills are abilities an individual learns over time. Each skill represents the training and methods a character has picked up that enable her to use her natural attributes in a certain way. To reflect this connection, each skill is linked to an attribute. A list of skills and their linked attributes appears in the Skills and Linked Attributes Table, below.

Skills are grouped into two broad categories: Active, and Knowledge. Characters begin the game with a set of skills chosen by the player.

During game play, characters can improve or specialize in skills, or learn new ones as they experience new things. 

**Active Skills**


Active skills are the skills characters use to take action, affect something, or somehow make an impact. These skills are the ones that usually matter the most to characters. Firing a gun, negotiating, driving a car , and so on. For a complete description of base Active skills and specializations see below.

**Knowledge Skills**


Knowledge Skills represent what a character knows about certain subjects. Beginning Knowledge skills are based on a character’s Willpower and Logic attributes. Knowledge skills are useful for fleshing out a character by defining her background or areas of interest, and are used in the game most often to represent legwork, show character development, or allow characters to come up with information they might not otherwise have a chance to gain. they can range from fields of knowledge important in the game universe—such as Corporate Finance, Political History, Research, or Magic—to more esoteric, bizarre, or mundane interests such as trash Metal Bands, or Elven Wines.

Knowledge skills fall into four categories: Stree, Academic, Interests, and Professional.

Each category presents an opportunity to shape the experiences of a character far beyond what happens on a run. Knowledge skills do not affect tests the way Active skills do. In certain cases Knowledge skills may provide the background needed to complete an action, but they typically do not provide dice for Active skill tests. You get a number of free Knowledge skill points at character creation. Skill advancement and additional Knowledge skills follow the skill advancement rules (Character Advancement).

Knowledge skills complement your character. They create meaning and history behind the Active skills and abilities you choose. Shadowrun gives you some room to play with Knowledge skills. You’re free to take practically any Knowledge skill your can think up for your character. Knowledge skills are meant to represent a limited set of knowledge the character could have gained in some in-game fashion. For example, a kid growing up in an Evo corporate enclave could have a skill in Corporate Culture. On the other hand, had she tried to take Culture as a Knowledge skill, it would have been way too broad to be a Knowledge skill and her gamemaster would have told her she needs to narrow it down a bit. Check out the Knowledge Skill Examples to get a good idea about how to hit the Knowledge skill sweet spot

**STREET KNOWLEDGE**


Street Knowledge is linked to Intuition. This type of Knowledge skill is about knowing the movers and shakers in an urban area, along with how things get done on the street. You know about the people who live in different neighborhoods, who to ask to get what, and where things are. The information that these skills cover tends to change rapidly, but your instincts help you keep up.

**ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE**


Academic knowledge is linked to Logic. This type of knowledge includes university subjects such as history, science, design, technology, magical theory, and the people and organizations with fingers in those pies. The humanities (cultures, art, philosophy, and so on) are also included in this category.

**PROFESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE**


Professional Knowledge skills deal with subjects related to normal trades, professions, and occupations, things like journalism, engineering, business, and so on. You might find them helpful when doing legwork for a run, especially those in the corporate world. All Professional Knowledge skills are linked to Logic.

**INTERESTS**


Strange as it might sound, you might have some hobbies outside of slinging mana and bullets. Interests are the kind of Knowledge skill that describes what you know because of what you do for fun. There are no guidelines (and no limit) to the sort of interest skills you can have. Interest Knowledge skills are linked to Intuition.

**Languages**


There are few situations where language skills should require a dice roll. Characters with a language skill don’t need to make tests to understand one another in every day situations. The character’s skill level serves as a benchmark for how well they can communicate in a foreign language over time. However, in critical situations where precise translation is important, a gamemaster may elect to require a Language skill test. For more information, see Using Language Skills.

**LINGOS**


Lingos are informal languages formed out of a mother tongue and heavy with slang, jargon, and culturally significant metaphorical language. Lingos arise out of professional and often cultural need. For example, the Cityspeak word ”wiz” came from jargon specific to the magically active. Lingos are specializations of base languages.

| Name       | Meaning                                                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cityspeak  | A Japanese/English pidgin spoken in Seattle                   |
| Creole     | A French/English hybrid spoken in the CAS                     |
| Street     | Localized jive based on a city’s street population            |
| ‘l33tspeak | Decker code talk                                              |
| Milspec    | Military jargon shared between soldiers/mercs                 |
| Corp       | Technical banter shared by corporate office staff and lawyers |
| Orbital    | Jargon shared by off-world colonies                           |

**USING LANGUAGE SKILLS**


A gamemaster may elect to call for a Language Test anytime information needs to be translated hurriedly or in a tense situation. The Language Skill Table suggests thresholds for the test as well as possible modifiers. Failing a Language Test means the parties are unable to understand each other. If a glitch is rolled, some meaningful portion of the information is presumed to be understood but is actually misunderstood. The gamemaster may want to make the Language Test secretly, in order to maintain the illusion that the characters understand what is going on.

**Skill Ratings**

Skill ratings are the numerical values assigned to skills or skill groups, either at character creation or when the skill is learned during game play. They represent how good a character is at a task when using that particular skill. Skill ratings are written as the name of the skill, followed by the rating. For example, Sneaking 3 means the character has the Sneaking Skill at a rating of 3. The skill rating is added to the linked attribute to determine the modifier added to 3D6 when that skill is used. For example, if the character with Sneaking 3 also had an Agility 4, she would add 7 to her rolls on a Sneaking Test.

The skill Rating is a numerical value ranging from 1, representing the most rudimentary skill, to 7 (or 13 with the Aptitude quality) representing the height of sentient achievement. 

The unmodified skill rating assigned at character creation or purchased during game play is considered to be the character’s base skill rating. Some abilities and implants (as noted) may increase this rating, creating a modified skill rating. A modified skill cannot exceed the base skill rating x 1.5. Specializations, spells, and other implants may provide a bonus to a skill, but do not change the base skill rating. These extra modifiers are listed in parentheses after the base skill, as in Sneaking 4 (+2)

| Rating | Definition   |
| ------ | ------------ |
| -      | Unaware      |
| 0      | Untrained    |
| 1      | Beginner     |
| 2      | Novice       |
| 3      | Professional |
| 4      | Veteran      |
| 5      | Expert       |
| 6      | Elite        |
| 7      | Legendary    |

### Specializations

If you devote extra time to a subset of a skill, it’s called a specialization. If your character has the Gymnastics skill but spends a lot of time practicing parkour, you get a character that is good at Gymnastics but especially good at climbing past obstacles.

A specialization adds +2 modifier to any test made for that skill when the specialization comes into play. You write the specialization in parentheses right after the skill, and then add a “(+2)” after the rating to remind you of the bonus. Characters can have multiple specializations within the same skill, but one applies at a time. For example, a character with the Blades skill who specializes in Axes and Parrying would only receive a +2 modifier to tests when parrying with an axe.

New characters may only take one specialization per skill at character creation (Creating a Character), but you can buy more later. If you want a specialization in a skill, you have to have it first (meaning a Rating of at least 1). 

### Defaulting

It is impossible to prepare for every scenario and only slightly harder to have every skill. When you perform an action without actually having the skill for the test, there’s still hope. You can default the skill, making the test using only the attribute to form the modifier. You don’t have any tremendous talent when you default— quite the opposite in fact. Defaulting imposes a –1 modifier in addition to any other modifiers the situation demands. Unless the gamemaster feels that you’re at a complete loss when defaulting, you can use Edge to Push the Limit and better your chances.

Some skills are too technically demanding for you to default. In these cases, you don’t get to even try the test; you just fail. Vehicles or Unarmed Combat, for example, are relatively simple skills that can be attempted without formal training, so you can default if you need to. Mechanics, on the other hand, is too complicated to try without some training (you could say it’s rocket science). Skills that cannot be defaulted are given in italics on the Active Skill List—and it’s also mentioned in the skill description.

#### Knowledge Skill Examples 

Knowledge skills are about what the character knows,
even if you, the player, don’t. Check out the KnowledgeSkill Table for a few guidelines on what a skill reveals.
Keep in mind that general facts, such as the name of
the head of a megacorp and such, is info that can be
quickly found on the Matrix. Knowledge skills are not
about that basic level of detail, but rather information
that not everyone knows or can find so easily.

**USING ESCAPE ARTIST**


In Shadowrun, you might just find yourself caught instead of killed. Escape Artist provides a chance to escape from most forms of confinement, including ropes, handcuffs, and other bindings. To get out of restraints, make an `Escape Artist + Agility [Physical]` Test against a Threshold based on what you’re trying to get out of. If you succeed, you’re free after working on it for one minute (20 Combat Turns), divided by the number of net effect you get on the test. The dice is modified by a variety of factors, such as whether or not you’re being watched (and trying to be subtle) or if you’re carrying a set of lockpicks. These situational modifiers are on the Escape Artist Table. The gamemaster may decide that some restraints are too difficult to escape from without outside help.

**Escape Artist Table**

| **RESTRAINTS**                           | **THRESHOLD**            |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Rope, plastic cuffs                      | 2                        |
| Metal handcuffs                          | 3                        |

| **SITUATION**                            | **MODIFIER**             |
| Character being watched                  | –2                       |
| Character physically restrained          | –(Restrainer’s Strength) |
| Character has picks or cutting implement | +2                       |



##### FREE-FALL (BODY)

This skill covers any jump from height, including leaps from a third-floor window to jumps from a plane at high altitude. If it involves any kind of attempt to slow or control your fall, this covers it, so it includes skydiving with a parachute, flying a wingsuit, or descending on a line, bungee cord, or zipline.


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: None
- Specializations: BASE Jumping, Break-Fall, Bungee, HALO, Low Altitude, Parachute, Static Line, Wingsuit, Zipline

##### GYMNASTICS (AGILITY)

Gymnastics measures your balance, general athleticism, and all-around ability to use your body. For more information on ways Gymnastics may be applied ingame, see Jumping.


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: Athletics
- Specializations: Balance, Climbing, Dance, Leaping, Parkour, Rolling

**USING GYMNASTICS**


**CLIMBING**

The Gymnastics skill is applied to both assisted and unassisted climbing tasks. Assisted climbing is accomplished with specialized gear such as ropes and harnesses. Assisted climbing is easier and safer, but requires more preparation. Unassisted climbing may be done on the fly, because you climb without any gear. Climbing is a Major Action, and the number of effect you get on your `Gymnastics + Strength [Physical]` Test determines how far you can move vertically or laterally during your climb, as noted on the Climbing Table. The more difficult the climb, the more modifiers you get, which is also noted on the Climbing Table.

**Climbing Table**

| **SITUATION**                                            | **Movement Distance R/up**   |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Assisted climbing down (rappelling)                      | 20 yards + 1 yard per effect |
| Assisted climbing upward                                 | 1 yard per effect            |
| Assisted climbing horizontally                           | 1 yard per 2 effect          |
| Assisted climbing upside down (on a ceiling or overhang) | 1 yard per 3 effect          |
| Unassisted climbing upward                               | 1 yard per 2 effect          |
| Unassisted climbing down                                 | 1 yard per effect            |
| **SITUATION**                                            | **MODIFIER**                 |
| Assisted climbing                                        | +2                           |
| **SURFACE IS**                                           | **MODIFIER**                 |
| Easily climbable (chain-link fence)                      | +1                           |
| Broken (tree, loose stone wall)                          | +0                           |
| Flat (brick wall, side of old building)                  | –3                           |
| Sheer (metal wall, seamless stone)                       | –5                           |
| Slippery or wet                                          | –2                           |
| Greased or gel-treated                                   | –4                           |


**RAPPELLING**

Rappelling is a gear-aided descent at near free-fall speed. This technique requires a `Free-Fall + Body [Physical] (3)` Success Test. So long as you have the proper gear and training, you can brake at any point in the descent, slow your speed, and land safely. Rappelling expends a Minor Action, during which you fall at a rate of 20 yards per Combat Turn. Rappelling characters can increase the number of yards descended during that same Combat Turn by 1 for each net effect beyond the threshold on the Free-Fall Test. If you take another Minor Action in the same phase, such as firing a weapon, you get a –2 modifier to both that action and the Free-Fall Test. Stopping requires another Free-Fall Test with the same threshold. On an unsuccessful test, you don’t slow down and may take damage if you hit the ground at speed (Falling Damage).

**CLIMBING FAILURES AND GLITCHES**

A test while climbing or rappelling automatically halts your progress, and you have to make a `Reaction + Strength` Test to hold on. If you fail this second test, you start to fall (about 20 yards per Combat Turn). During your next turn, you may attempt to stop by making a `Reaction + Strength Test` with a –2 modifier. Your gamemaster may allow other climbers to make a `Reaction + Strength` Test to grab you. Characters who are using climbing gear are allowed an additional test if they fall. Have the character who prepared the safety lines make a `Free-Fall + Logic [Mental]` Test against a threshold equal to half the falling character’s Body (round down). The falling character may apply Edge to this test. If successful, the safety gear catches, leaving the character dangling. If it fails, the character falls (see Falling Damage).

**JUMPING**

Jumping is done from a running or standing position. Running leaps get more distance than standing jumps do, if you have enough room to get up to full speed. Make a `Gymnastics + Agility Test`, applying any appropriate modifiers. For every Effect you get on this test, you jump 1 yard on a standing jump or 2 yards for a running leap. No matter how many effect you get, you can’t jump farther than your Agility x 1.5 yards (net effect beyond this mean you did it with style). For a vertical jump, it’s the same test, but you get half a yard of altitude per hit and the maximum you can jump is 1.5 times your height.


##### PALMING (AGILITY)

Palming is sleight-of-hand skill that gives a character the ability to snag, hide, and pass off small objects.


- Default: No
- Skill Group: Stealth
- Specializations: Legerdemain, Pickpocket, Pilfering

##### PERCEPTION (INTUITION)

Perception refers to the ability to spot anomalies in everyday situations, making it one of the key skills a shadowrunner needs. See Using Perception.


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: None
- Specializations: Hearing, Scent, Searching, Taste, Touch, Visual

**USING PERCEPTION**

Perception Tests are for any situation involving basic senses (sight, hearing, smell, touch, or taste) where you’re looking for something that isn’t obvious. Your gamemaster might call for you to make one, or you can call for a Perception Test by taking an Use Skill Major Action to get a handle on what’s going down around you. Making the Threshold on a `Perception + Intuition [Mental]` Test indicates that you’ve noticed something subtle or important (or both)—net effect determine how much detail you get. If someone is deliberately trying to hide from you, they’ll oppose your test with their own skill (Using Stealth Skills). Perception Tests involving vision (which is most of them) use the same Visibility and Light modifiers as attacks do in combat (Environmental Modifiers). Other modifiers are listed on the Perception Test Modifiers table. If a bunch of people are making a Perception Test and looking for the same thing, use a Teamwork Test.

**Perception Test Modifiers table**

| **SITUATION**                                       | **MODIFIER**          |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |

##### RUNNING (STRENGTH)

Running, as you may guess, is about how much ground you can cover quickly. For more information see Using Running.


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: Athletics
- Specializations: Distance, Sprinting, by terrain (Desert, Urban, Wilderness, etc.)

**USING RUNNING**

The Running skill allows you to increase the distance you can cover in a Combat Turn by taking a Dash Action on your turn. You make a `Running + Strength [Physical] Test`. Each effect adds 1 or 2 yards to your distance for that Combat Turn, based on your metatype (see Movement). The gamemaster may apply modifiers for various types of terrain (rocky, slippery, and so on) and other conditions. You can run non-stop for a maximum number of minutes equal to your `(Body + Running) x 10`. Fatigue damage begins to take effect after this point (see Fatigue Damage).

##### SNEAKING (AGILITY)

Need to get where you’re not supposed to be? This skill allows you to remain inconspicuous in various situations. See Using Stealth Skills.


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: Stealth
- Specializations: Location type (Jungle, Urban, Desert, etc.)

##### SURVIVAL (WILLPOWER)

In the desert with nothing more than a tin cup, a poncho, and an iron rod? You’ll need this skill to help you get out alive. Survival is the ability to stay alive in extreme environmental conditions for extended periods of time. The skill governs a character’s ability to perform vital outdoor tasks such as start a fire, build a shelter, scrounge for food, etc. in hostile environments. See Using Survival.


- Default: Yes

**USING SURVIVAL**

Surviving the elements is more dangerous in the Sixth World. Environmental decay has reached unparalleled heights. In Great Britain, for example, a perfect storm of toxic disasters and severe flooding devastated the countryside. Those forced to live on city streets fare no better. The homeless are as likely to be attacked by a swarm of devil rats as they are to be beaten by a ganger looking for a bit of fun.

The Survival skill is used for braving all forms of extreme outdoor conditions—this includes urban survival, where the threats are as likely to come from other people as they are from the elements. It covers the ability to find food, water, and temporary shelter in any environment. If you’re exposed to these conditions for 24 hours or more, you’ll need to start making daily `Survival + Willpower [Mental] Tests`. Modifiers and thresholds for Survival Tests are provided on the Survival Test Table. If you fail the test, you don’t find the food or shelter you need and take Stun damage with a Damage Value equal to twice the threshold step. The Stun damage cannot be healed until you get a good night’s sleep without having to make a Survival Test. If your Stun Condition Monitor overflows and you fall unconscious, you cannot make your Survival Tests, so you just keep taking the damage (now Physical from overflow) until you’re either rescued or dead.

**Survival Test Table**

| **WILDERNESS TERRAIN**              | **THRESHOLD** | **STUN DAMAGE ON FAIL** |

##### SWIMMING (STRENGTH)

This skill determines the character’s ability to swim in various bodies of water. The skill level affects the distance and speed at which a character can swim. See Using Swimming


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: Athletics
- Specializations: Dash, Long Distance

**USING SWIMMING**

Swimming is a Major Action. A swimming character can move a number of yards in a Combat Turn equal to the average of their Agility and Strength. You can take a Minor Action to dash with a `Swimming + Strength [Physical] Test`, adding 1 yard per effect, or 2 yards per effect if you’re an elf or a troll. Swimming on the surface of water or under it does not affect this rate of speed. As with the Running skill, swimmers suffer from fatigue after an extended time (Fatigue Damage).

**HOLDING YOUR BREATH**

Sixty seconds (twenty Combat Turns) is the base time a character can hold his breath before any tests are needed. A character needing to hold his breath longer can make a `Swimming + Willpower Test` (with the Controlled Hyperventilation specialization coming into play if you have it). Each net hit extends the clock by 15 seconds (5 Combat Turns).

Once the time expires the character must breathe or take 3 of Stun damage at the end of each Combat Turn until they breathe (this damage cannot be resisted). Once all the stun is gone, the character loses consciousness. At this point the character takes 3 physical damage at the end of each Combat Turn until rescued or dead.

**TREADING WATER**

If you’re just trying to keep afloat, you can tread water. You can tread water for a number of minutes equal to your Strength rating. At the end of this time, make a Simple `Swimming + Strength [Physical] (12) Test`. Success means you can keep treading water (or float, if you’re skilled at Swimming) for the same amount of time before another test; failure means you slip and take 3 Stun damage that you can’t resist. If you have a flotation device, double the time between tests. You can keep treading water as long as you can stay conscious.

##### TRACKING (INTUITION)

This skill confers the ability to detect the passage of metahumans and other game through terrain and use those clues to follow that individual. This skill also allows you to identify unmarked trails and common game paths is various environments. See Using Tracking.


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: Outdoors
- Specializations: Desert, Forest, Jungle, Mountain, Polar, Urban, another terrain type

**USING TRACKING**

Tracking a person or critter requires a `Tracking + Intuition [Mental] Test` with a threshold based on the terrain (decided by the gamemaster using the Threshold table). If the target is actively obscuring their trail, tracking is handled as an Opposed Test. The tracker rolls `Tracking + Intuition [Mental]` against the target’s `Sneak + Agility [Physical]`. Any effect on a Tracking Test can be used to gain additional information about the trail, such as the number of people using the trail, type of critters recently using it, and how old the tracks are. In urban tracking, additional effect can be used to identify local crowd movement patterns, relevant cameras, and AR clues that reveal where the target was heading and how long ago it passed by. The gamemaster may choose to apply modifiers for conditions such as weather, age of the tracks, the amount of people who’ve trampled the trail, and so on. Individuals using a tracking dog or other tracking critter may use Animal Handling as a Teamwork Test for their animal’s Tracking Test.

#### Social Active Skills

Dice rarely need to get involved when characters need to solve problems between one another. Dealing with NPCs isn’t always so easy. Social skills give characters the ability to problem-solve without expending bullets or mana. These skills tend to be linked to the Charisma attribute

Social skills are intended to be used to complement good role-playing, not replace it. The Social Test should come either at the end of a well-role-played scene to wrap it up, or in place of a social situation that would be less interesting to actually play through to get through it quickly. The gamemaster can provide modifiers on this test based on how well you make your point, or how much bulldrek you’re able to pile up without flinching.

##### CON (CHARISMA)

Con governs the ability to manipulate or fool an NPC during a social encounter. This skill covers a range of confidence games as well as the principles behind those cons.


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: Acting
- Specializations: Fast Talking, Seduction

##### ETIQUETTE (CHARISMA)

Etiquette represents the level of understanding and awareness of proper social rituals. The skill works as a sort of social version of Sneak, allowing you to move unimpeded through various social situations. Etiquette also serves as a social safety net in case a player botches a social situation in a way a skilled character would not. See Using Etiquette.


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: Influence
- Specializations: By culture or subculture (Corporate, High Society, Media, Mercenary, Street, Yakuza, etc.)

**USING ETIQUETTE**

Etiquette is about blending into the social fabric. Skilled characters can move through a social situation without anyone realizing that they don’t belong. It’s more than knowing the right mores (you could look those up on the Matrix), it’s about trained instinct.

You can use Etiquette to ease suspicions, so that people might trust you more than they would an outsider. Make an `Etiquette + Charisma [Social] Test` against the other person’s `Perception + Charisma [Social] Opposed Test`. If you get you roll higher, they’ll accept you. If you get 3 or more net effect, their attitude toward you will improve, moving up a line on the “NPC’s attitude” section of the Social Modifiers table.

The skill is not meant to replace role-playing, but it can save you from a social blunder that you (the player) make when your character probably wouldn’t have. When this happens, make an Etiquette Test against a threshold equal to the severity of the blunder (set by the gamemaster). A successful test means your character recovers from the misstep.

When making Etiquette tests with a group of NPCs, use the same rules for influencing groups (Using Social Skills).

A glitch on an Etiquette Test is treated the same as a social blunder—the temporary annoyance could give you a –2 modifier on your next social test. Critical glitches result in major social gaffes that have a lasting effect on the relationship your character has with others—the NPC’s stance towards your character could move one step toward Enemy. This is the stuff of which long-time grudges and major feuds are made, the words of disrespect that set street armies into motion.

##### IMPERSONATION (CHARISMA)

Impersonation is the ability to assume the identity of another person, including voice and physical mannerisms. The skill is limited by the physical abilities of the character. A dwarf might be able to impersonate a troll over a commlink, but the illusion shatters when he is face to face with his target.


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: Acting
- Specializations: By metahuman type (Dwarf, Elf, Human, Ork, Troll)

##### INSTRUCTION (CHARISMA)

Instruction governs the ability to teach people. The skill level helps determine how comfortable the instructor is delivering new material as well as how complex of a skill may be taught. See Using Instruction.


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: None
- Specializations: By Active or Knowledge skill category (Combat, Language, Magical, Academic Knowledge, Street Knowledge, etc.)

**USING INSTRUCTION**

From virtual instructors to how-to vids, there are numerous ways to learn skills. There is no substitute, however, for a flesh-and-blood instructor. In order to teach someone a skill, a character must have the skill at Rating 2 or higher. The teacher can only teach up to their own Instruction Rating. Teaching is an `Instruction + Charisma [Social] Test`. Every effect on the Teaching Test reduces the time for the student to improve their skill by a day (Character Advancement).

Instruction is also used to teach spells, complex forms, rituals, and various other techniques. The rules for using Instruction are a bit different in these cases and are explained in the appropriate sections of this book


##### INTIMIDATION (CHARISMA)

Intimidation is about creating the impression that you are more menacing than another person in order to get them to do what you want. The skill may be applied multiple ways, from negotiation to interrogation. Intimidation is an Opposed `Intimidation + Charisma [Social]` Test against the target’s `Charisma + Willpower`, modified by the appropriate entries on the Social Modifiers Table.


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: None
- Specializations: Interrogation, Mental, Physical, Torture

##### LEADERSHIP (CHARISMA)

Leadership is the ability to direct and motivate others. It’s like Con, except rather than using deception you’re using a position of authority. This skill is especially helpful in situations where the will of a teammate is shaken or someone is being asked to do something uncomfortable. The Leadership skill is not meant to replace or make up for poor teamwork. When using Leadership make an opposed test `Charisma + Leadership`. See Using Social Influence Skills, for test modifiers.


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: Influence
- Specializations: Command, Direct, Inspire, Rally

**USING LEADERSHIP**

The Leadership skill is about coaxing, convincing, threatening, or challenging your subordinates, or getting people to accept you as a superior. If you lead people who accept you as their (lone) superior, even temporarily, you can take a Major Action to make a `Leadership + Charisma [Social] Test`. How this helps depends on what you choose to do.

Command: The target resists with a `Leadership + Willpower [Mental] test` (with Social Modifiers). For every net hit you get, the target accepts you as their leader for 1 Combat Turn. This doesn’t work if you’ve failed on this target before.

Direct: Your effect act as a Teamwork Test for one subordinate’s skill or Composure Test that they perform on or before their next Turn.

Inspire: Your effect act as a Teamwork Test for your subordinates’ Surprise Test for the rest of the Combat Turn.

Rally: Your subordinates add 1 to their Initiative Score for every 2 effect you get.

##### NEGOTIATION (CHARISMA)

Negotiation governs a character’s ability to apply their charisma, tactics, and knowledge of situational psychology in order to create a better position when making deals.


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: Influence
- Specializations: Bargaining, Contracts, Diplomacy

##### PERFORMANCE (CHARISMA)

This skill governs the ability to execute a performing art. Performance is to the arts what Artisan is to craft. The performer uses her skill to entertain or even captivate an audience. See Using Performance.


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: Acting
- Specializations: By performance art (Presentation, Acting, Comedy, specific Musical Instrument, etc.)

**USING PERFORMANCE**

Performance is a Simple Test with a Social limit—the gamemaster can use your effect to gauge the artistry of your performance. If you’re trying distract a target, or sweep them up in your performance, the generic modifiers on the Social Modifiers Table apply, and your target(s) use their `Charisma + Willpower` to oppose your test.





#### Magic Active Skills

##### ALCHEMY (MAGIC)

Alchemy is used to create substances that store spells. Alchemy is most commonly used to brew potions, distill magical reagents, and even create orichalcum.


- Default: No
- Skill Group: Enchanting
- Specializations: By trigger (Command, Contact, Time), by spell type (Combat Spells, Detection Spells, etc.)

##### ARCANA (LOGIC)

Arcana governs the creation of magical formulae used to create spells, foci, and all other manner of magical manipulations. Arcana is required to understand formulae that may be purchased over the counter or discovered by other means.


- Default: No
- Skill Group: None

- Skill Group: None
- Specializations: Counterfeiting, Credstick Forgery, False ID, Image Doctoring, Paper Forgery

**USING FORGERY**

Talented forgers can simulate anything from a signature to a credstick to the Mona Lisa. The skill is most often used for doctoring hardcopy IDs, signatures, and official paperwork, but it can be used to fabricate anything you can imagine and your skill level can handle. Creating a forgery is a `Forgery + Logic Test`. The limit for this test is either Physical (for forged art, signatures,and other physical objects) or Mental (for credsticks, documents, and other items that are more data than substance). Your dice pool is adjusted by appropriate modifiers (see the Build/Repair Table for suggestions), and given a time requirement by the gamemaster (an interval from the Extended Test Difficulties table is fine).

The quality of the forgery is based on the number of hits scored on the test. This number acts as the threshold for attempts to spot the fake. Anyone examining a forgery makes an Opposed Test using a `Perception + Intuition [Mental]` Test or `Forgery + Intuition [Mental]` Test. If they score as many or more hits than the quality of the forgery, the item is exposed as a fake.

Data-based forgeries, like credsticks, documents, and SINs, don’t really hold up well to scrutiny, what with information being so readily available. They can appear almost identical to the original, but any attempt to get it to act like the original (transfer nuyen, pass a SIN check, etc.) reveals the forgery.

**USING NAVIGATION**

Since the advent of AR mapping, a walk through the sprawl never requires a test, but getting from A to B can be a lot tougher when the Matrix isn’t pointing the way. Navigation tests are required when you’re traversing unmarked or highly unfamiliar terrain, such as someone new to Seattle attempting to navigate the Ork Underground. It’s a Simple Navigation + Intuition [Mental] Test, with a threshold based on the terrain, taking into account modifiers for environmental factors such as poor visibility, landmarks, existing trails, advice from locals, and so on—your gamemaster will give you a tn

##### SOFTWARE (LOGIC)

Software is the skill used to create and manipulate programming in the Matrix. See Using Software.

- Default: No
- Skill Group: Electronics
- Specializations: Data Bombs or by complex form (Editor, Resonance Spike, Tattletale, etc.)

##### BUILDING & REPAIRING

Building or repairing an object is an Extended Test that the gamemaster may decide requires certain tools or facilities. Modifiers from the Build/Repair Table /should be applied to the test. Characters electing to design new items must have the appropriate Knowledge skills to conceptualize and create schematics. The gamemaster assigns a threshold and interval for the Extended Test using the Task Difficulty Table

## Chapter 7: Equipment

You’re only as good as your gear. It’s a common saying, but it’s true, especially on the mean streets of the Sixth World. Having the wrong gear at the right time or the right gear at the wrong time are both potentially fatal flaws. Either way you’re probably going to end up in a world of hurt, or worse.

### Gear Stats

The key functions of any piece of gear in Shadowrun are expressed in its game stats. The exact categories of stats depend on the item’s type. Cost is a universal stat—everything costs money—and all items also have Availability. We’ll cover that and some of the more specialized stats.

#### Availability

Availability expresses how easy it is to find a piece of gear. The higher the number, the more scarce the item is. Availabilities typically range from 1 to 6, but circumstances can push them up to 9.

Note that the top levels of Availability are primarily reserved for alphaware, betaware, and deltaware versions of augmentations.

Availability ratings give a general sense to the gamemaster of whether player characters can find a given item, but they also can be used in mechanics in two ways. First, the Availability rating can be used as a threshold in Matrix Search tests to find someone who carries the item—though the gamemaster should note that just because the players find a seller doesn’t mean that seller will be easily accessible. Second, players may ask a contact to locate an item. 

Generally speaking, contacts can find goods whose Availability is less than (not equal to) their Connection rating. Whether they connect the player characters to the gear is a question of Loyalty and role-playing.

**Availability**

- 1 These items can be found just about anywhere. If you’re in a relatively civilized area, just walk a few blocks, and you’ll find a place that sells this.
- 2 These items are a bit more specialized, but that mainly means you’ll have to seek out a store that focuses on this type of merchandise, rather than finding it in your local Stuffer Shack or whatever.
- 3 These are starting to be boutique items, the type of things aficionados seek out, or things that are made in relatively small batches. They’re not the rarest items, but they’re also not sitting in a ton of stores across the sprawl.
- 4 Now we’re getting into specialty markets. These are things not intended for mass markets, and their specialized function isn’t for everyone. Few people in any given sprawl carry them, and their supplies are limited.
- 5 True specialty items. These may be collector’s items or things deliberately made for a niche audience, but they are not at all easy to find.
- 6 These are quite rare, often hand-crafted items. Small workshops and specialty manufacturers make them, and you’ll never find them at a major retailer. Work hard, and you might track a by-appointment seller who will sell you one.
- 7 These items are not available off-the-rack. They are specially ordered and custom-made.
- 8 Same as 7, but you have to make an appointment to order one, and you may be subjected to a background check based on whatever obscure criteria the manufacturer has decided to assemble.
- 9 The most rare items money can buy—you just have to find the person who will take your cash. Owning one of these marks you as a member of the elite, and selling one of them brings in extra cash due to their scarcity.

#### Legality

Some items are listed with an (I) or (L) as part of their Availability rating. The former refers to items that are illegal for private ownership in most places, which means they are only allowed in the possession of security, megacorporate, or government entities. The latter designation is attached to items that require a license in order to legally possess or transport them. Licenses are bought and attached to SINs (or fake SINs). The legal status of any given item is dependent on the local laws. What’s legal in the UCAS may not be legal in CalFree, or vice versa. The listings here are for the UCAS and Seattle in particular, as the UCAS has several laws (like gun possession) that vary by state.

#### Active Program Slots

This shows how many programs an electronic device can have running at a single time.

#### Attack Rating


Close 0-3 yds, Near 4-50 yds, Medium 51-250 yds, Far 251-500 yds, Extreme 500 yds

#### Ammo

This is the ammo capacity a firearm has, as well as the type of container—(belt) belt, (c) clip, (cy) cylinder, (m) magazine, (ml) missile, or (z) muzzle loaders.

#### Armor Rating
This is the boost to a character’s Toughness.

#### Blast
This is the size of a blast of an explosive.

#### Capacity
Some items can hold modifications and other
adaptations, and they have a Capacity rating to indicate
how much they can hold. Other items take
up this space—those items have a Capacity rating
listed in brackets [].

#### Damage Value (DV)
This is used for weapons and is the base damage
the weapon inflicts if it hits. It may have a letter
indicating its elemental damage, such as (e) for
electricity or (f) for fire. For explosives, this is listed
at different ranges, including ground zero (GZ),
Close, and Near ranges.

#### Device Rating
Used for electronic devices, this is a kind of
all-purpose stat that reflects the devices overall
power and systems integrity.

#### Essence
Used for cyberware and bioware, this shows the
Essence reduction you experience when installing
this item.

#### Modes
These are the firing modes firearms use.

#### Mount
This describes where an accessory is placed

#### Rating
If an item has a range of ratings in which it is available, it is listed in this column or next to the item’s name.

> Why isn't range listed? Because its a dumb concept in a TTRPG. I can hit a target with an AR-15 at almost a mile out. Basically if I can see it, its in range. Thats why. I love Gygax as much as the next guy but a Longbow fired by a professional can hit a target at a 100 yards easily which is also within site.

### Moving Gear

#### Standard Goods

Some general assumptions of item ownership come with the purchase of a Lifestyle. Basic clothing and doss furnishings would be included along with general amenities appropriate to the Lifestyle level. These items only need to be worried about when a character loses their Lifestyle or doss due to unforeseen circumstances, but they are replaced as soon as the runner buys a new Lifestyle.

#### Starting Gear

Runners use the funds they get at character creation to buy their initial gear. This includes arms, armor, tech, vehicles, and everything else that wouldn’t be a normal part of everyday life. These items should have some kind of note on where they are stored, because the runner could lose items if they keep them in their vehicle and it gets stolen, keep them at their base and it gets burned, or keep them on their person and they get pinched

#### Fencing Gear

Let’s make this simple. In order to fence the valuables you come across, you need a contact who’s in the right field (your bartender contact isn’t going to be the most useful helping you unload that cyberdeck prototype you lifted from Mitsuhama). If you have the right contact, you can get back ten percent of the base value on the item, plus one percent for every Effect on an `Influence + Charisma test (Avail)`. If the item is particularly hot or desired (according to the gamemaster’s discretion) the whole selling process could be more adventurous and offer a bigger payday, but that’s up to the individual running the show.

#### Concealing Gear

Sometimes you want to keep your stuff away from prying eyes. There is no active test for hiding gear—you put it in its carrier or holster or whatever and hope the equipment does its job. Spotting gear is based on a Concealability Threshold that is used in Perception tests. Items have a base Threshold based on their general size and shape; some items change this based on their design, whether they are built to be hidden or bulkier than normal and hard to make disappear. All these thresholds assume the item is being hidden by the owner—if you’re holding the item openly in your hand, the Concealability threshold would not apply.

| **SIZE**       | **Threshold THRESHOLD** | **EXAMPLE**             |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Large          | 0                       | Assault Cannon          |
| Bulky          | 6                       | Assault Rifle           |
| Tuckable       | 12                      | SMG                     |
| Pocket Size    | 18                      | Light Pistol            |
| Palm size      | 24                      | Deck of Cards           |
| Slim palm size | 24 + 2 Effect           | Single Card             |
| Palmable       | 24 + 3 Effect           | Lighter                 |
| Small          | 24 + 4 Effect           | 6 sided die             |
| Mini           | 24 + 5 Effect           | Stealth RFID Tag        |
| Fine           | 24 + 6 Effect           | Powder traces           |
| Microscopic    | 24 + 7 Effect           | A flea on your shoulder |

#### Size Cost Adjustments
Most gear is built to be used by humans, or at least human-sized creatures. Elves and orks are close enough to human sizes that they can generally make this gear work for them, but it’s not as easy for dwarfs and trolls. They usually need to shop at special stores or order their gear with certain customizations made to it. To account for this, dwarfs pay a ten percent markup on all the fitted gear they purchase. This applies to items like armor and clothes Size Cost Adjustments Most gear is built to be used by humans, or at least human-sized creatures.

They usually need to shop at special stores or order their gear with certain customizations made to it. To account for this, dwarfs pay a ten percent markup on all the fitted gear they purchase. This applies to items like armor and clothes

**Using Unadapted Gear**

Sometimes a dwarf or a troll has to use someone else’s stuff or make do with what’s handy. Any time a dwarf or troll uses gear that is not adapted for them, they suffer a –2 penalty on all actions involving that gear. This means armor doesn’t close right, guns don’t fit right, commlinks aren’t easy to use, etc

#### Wireless Functionality

Nearly every device is wireless. The wireless revolution started for tracking purposes, though most of the tracking was about observing consumer behavior. The corps also found it useful for inventory tracking and seeing how people used their goods. The only trick was finding a way to make sure consumers had a reason to keep the wireless functionality on at all times. That led to … the wireless bonus!

**Wireless Bonus**

Many items have a bonus applied when they’re kept attached to the Matrix. For the bulk of the population, this is just a little convenient aid in their normal life, but for runners it is often a door- die decision, because leaving your Smartgun XI linked to the Matrix could be the little edge you need, or it could be your doom as you get hacked and the fancy electronics-laden SMG becomes a paperweight. Items with a bonus are listed, and some have it listed for the entire category as well.

**Turning It Off**

Separating yourself and your gear from the Matrix is easy. An `Electronics + Logic (6) Test` as a Minor Action is all it takes in combat. The rest of the time, you can just assume you can figure it out as long as you have the Electronics skill.

**Throwbacks**

These devices are older tech. Whether it’s because they’re incompatible with the current Matrix or devoid of a way to interface with it, they don’t have a way to connect and gain any bonus from the wireless world. They also can’t be hacked in any way shape or form other than the other use of the word, like when a troll swings his axe and hacks your antique rifle in half.

#### Melee Weapon Descriptions

**BLADES**


Sharp edges provide the lethal advantage to everything with a blade. Brute force works, but elegant style is just as effective with objects honed to a razor sharpness.

**Combat axe**

Whether you’re Neal the Firefighter or Neil the Ork Barbarian, you can swing an axe for both utility and violence. The combat axe come with a single or double blade and a hardened spring-loaded thrusting point for breaking glass or providing an unpleasant surprise. In the overmuscled hands of a 2080s street warrior, this weapon can be far deadlier than a firearm.

**Combat Knife**

A simple, elegant, efficient killing device with a chisel point to make light work of armor. It’s also carbon-coated black, so no reflections give away your approach.

**Forearm snap blades**

Don’t like getting implants but still want three razor sharp blades to pop out of your forearm? This is the weapon for you. The blades extend and retract through either a forearm muscle command or a wireless signal. Either way, it takes a Minor Action. 

Wireless bonus: The blades grant an extra Minor Action on the turn when they are extended or retracted.

**Katana**

The iconic two-handed sword of the samurai is standard issue for trid-series shadowrunners. Out on the street, the deadly blade teaches lessons to those who think the trope is solely about looks.

**Knife**

A catchall term for a variety of different deadly fighting blades. The style is up to you, but the stats are all the same.

**Polearm**

Take a long stick, add any of a dozen varieties of blades to the head, and you’ve got a polearm. Designed to keep distance between attacker and defender or strike at a mounted target, they’re not common street weapons. They’re nearly impossible to conceal, even for a troll, but they’re great at keeping problems at a safe distance.

**Survival knife**

Specifically designed with a cutting edge on one side and a serrated sawing edge on the other, the true “survival” piece of this knife is in the handle and its collection of accessories. In the handle you’ll find a GPS monitor, mini-multitool, and micro- lighter. The blade is coated with a photovoltaic skin that blacks out the blade to prevent unwanted reflection; when charged, the skin can be activated to provide two hours of light. Combat stats are the same as the combat knife.

Wireless bonus: The knife displays an ARO of local maps and your GPS position, along with providing basic biomonitor data when in your hand.

**Sword**

A heavy blade on a one-handed grip that comes in a variety of styles. The world’s dominant combat weapon for thousands of years until the firearm came along.

**CLUBS**

**Club**

The stats listed can be used for a range of objects, including an axe handle, baseball bat, crowbar, tire iron, wrench, or even a two-by-four with a couple nails in it. The price listed is for a professionally made, old-style police baton, but it would be relatively easy to find one for free in a pinch.

**Extendable baton**

This telescoping club can be extended with a wrist flick or a wireless signal. In its retracted form, it’s easier to conceal (Concealability threshold 4 when retracted, 2 when extended). Retracting or extending it is a Minor Action. Wireless bonus: You gain a bonus Minor Action on a turn when you retract or extend the baton.

**Sap**

Also known as a blackjack, this is a short, flexible club or a leather-wrapped iron, lead, or sand filled sack for thumping heads. It’s designed to be concealable, often fitting in the palm of the hand (Concealability threshold 4).

**Staff**

Speak softly and carry a big stick. This is that big stick. Available in composite, hardwood, high-carbon steel, and other materials.

**Stun baton**
A riot-control staple and viewed as a symbol of corporate-government oppression, this handy electrical prod is still useful for everyone in the shadows. The stun baton holds ten charges and regains one charge per ten seconds when plugged in. 

Wireless bonus: The stun baton recharges without being plugged in, regaining one charge per half hour of wireless-enabled time.

**Telescoping staff**

A big stick that starts out as a small stick. This metal and composite staff can telescope down to the size of a stun baton or a sword. It can be extended and locked in place by spinning or snapping it out in each direction and giving the handle a twist to lock it. Or it can use a wireless signal to activate the telescoping effect. Extending or retracting it takes a Minor Action.

Wireless bonus: You gain a bonus Minor Action on a turn when you retract or extend the baton.

**OTHER**

**Bike Chain**

Go-gangs love to pull the old equipment off their scrap bikes and smack other people with it. These heavy metal chains are brutal weapons, esespecially when backed by the speed of a motorcycle. You gain a bonus Minor Action on a turn when you use the Trip Minor Action with this weapon.

**Knucks**

Everything from a roll of quarters in the palm (though who has that lying around?) to brass knuckles to Ares Hardliner Gloves, these weapons move a fist from potentially deadly to a probably deadly by augmenting the structure of the hand with metals or composites.

**Monofilament Whip**

Striking fear in the hearts of those who have warily watched its serpentine glow since the 2050s. In the hands of a trained user, this terrifying weapon can cut through armor, flesh, and bone as easy as butter with every millimeter of its two meters of monofilament line. In the wrong hands, or even with a bad twist of a skilled wrist, that line can send you to the street doc looking for a new limb. The whip is stored in the specially designed compartment in the handle with a small weight that detaches when the weapon is activated. Glitches are handled as usual, but a critical glitch always requires the wielder to resist the base damage of the weapon.

Wireless bonus: The whip uses your visuals on the target to make small adjustments in targeting, and the whip adjusts its trajectory. This increases the Attack Rating by 2. Also, the whip’s built-in safety system retracts automatically instead of hitting you on a critical glitch.

#### Projectile Weapon Descriptions

**BOWS**

**Bow**

Everything from the traditional longbow of fiberglass or wood to the modern compound bow. These archaic weapons aren’t common on the streets of 2080. They have the advantage of being hacker-proof as long as you leave off the fancy add-ons. Nocking an arrow takes a Minor Action (Ready Weapon). Bows have a rating that indicates the minimum Strength you need to use the weapon. The weapon’s rating is also used to determine damage (maximum rating is 14). Arrows also have ratings, and they must equal or exceed that of the bow.

**Crossbow**

Modern crossbows are designed with autoloading systems, internal magazines that hold up to four bolts, and come in light, medium, and heavy designs. Light models are single-handed, while medium and heavy designs require two hands.

**Injection Arrow/Bolt**

The injection arrow or bolt causes its base damage while also delivering a payload of one dose of a drug or toxin. A successful hit must deal at least one damage after the Toughness. Injection arrows and bolts come at a base rating of 8. Higher-rating models are available for heavier bows, but lower-rating models aren’t sturdy enough to deliver this heavier projectile.

Wireless bonus: The injection can be delayed until a wireless signal is sent. The injection also doesn’t need any damage; it just needs at least 1 net effect.

**Throwing Knives/Shuriken**

From stars to spikes and everything in between, these stats cover all the muscle-powered, small throwing weapons on the market. Up to (Agility/2) of these weapons can be readied for throwing with a Ready Weapon action.

Wireless bonus: Successful hits leave wireless weapons in targets that can be used to predict movement patterns and offer an estimated location. A successful hit offers anyone wirelessly linked to the throwing weapon and using a smartlink system a +1 bonus for their attacks.



### Firearms

Leadslingers abound on the streets of 2080 (the name remains, even though lead rounds aren’t the norm anymore). For years, the streets managed to snag and use caseless rounds in order to stay clear of the law tracking them, but recent events have led arms manufacturers (a.k.a. the megacorps) to desire a tighter leash on their shadow assets, and cased ammo is becoming the norm once again, with each casing containing a microRFID to identify the weapon and location where it was fired. The glory of watching spent shells spinning through the air is back, and so are the back-alley reloads and scrubbed slugs to keep those of us in the shadows off the radar. Weapons are chambered for cased or caseless, with caseless ammo being marginally harder to track but tougher to find on the streets. 

Wireless bonus: All modern firearms are considered to be wireless-equipped and come with a digital ammunition counter and an ARO that tells you the ammo type loaded. If equipped with DNI, you gain a bonus Minor Action any turn when you eject a clip (for weapons that have them) or change fire modes (on models that have more than one).

#### Firearm Descriptions

Cold steel that spits hot lead. Slug-throwing firearms are by far the most common weapons on the streets of 2075. Each weapon is chambered to take either old-fashioned cased ammunition or caseless ammo. Most firearms load caseless ammunition, with fewer and fewer models coming in variants able to handle cased ammunition. Sure, releasing a storm of shell casings when you hold down the trigger looks awesome, but it’s impractical for the modern shadowrunner and their natural enemy, law enforcement and corporate security.

Firearms come with wireless capability and a digital ammunition counter. Ammunition is sold separately. All firearms have the following wireless bonuses in addition to any wireless bonuses on each model: 

**Wireless**: The weapon displays an ARO that tells you ammo levels and ammo type loaded. If you have a DNI, you get two additional benefits. First, ejecting a clip (for weapons that have them) is a Free Action rather than a Minor Action. Second, changing fire modes (on models that have more than one) is a Free Action rather than a Minor Action.

**TASERS**

Tasers are legal to carry and a great choice for non-lethally incapacitating someone. Tasers, like other electrical weapons, have a flat Armor Penetration value of –5 and deal electricity damage. Use the Pistols skill to fire a taser. Tasers can take only top-mounted accessories.

Defiance EX Shocker: This heavy-duty taser fires up to 4 darts that trail wires up to 20 yards long. The wired connection to the battery allows for a more powerful shock. Most modern tasers use wireless darts, so the Defiance EX Shocker is an exception. It also features contacts that allow it to be used as a stun weapon in melee (Accuracy 3, DV 8S(e), Reach 0). Wireless: A successful hit informs you of the status of the target’s basic health (and Condition Monitors).

Yamaha Pulsar: The darts of this taser contain wireless capacitors, meaning that the Pulsar eliminates the need for cumbersome wires. As a trade-off, it is slightly less powerful than the EX Shocker, although it can fire faster. It lacks the EX Shocker’s melee contacts. Wireless: A successful hit informs you of the status of the target’s basic health (and Condition Monitors).

**HOLD-OUTS**


Hold-out pistols are very concealable and are perfect for sneaking into a meet or wearing as a back-up piece. They don’t have much else going for them, being both weak and inaccurate. Use the Pistols skill when firing a hold-out pistol. Hold-outs can’t take accessories. 

Fichetti Tiffani Needler: Designed to appeal to social climbers and debutantes, the Tiffani Needler is available in a wide variety of colors and styles. It also has a special color-changing coating that can be manipulated via wireless signal. This is useful to make sure your gun matches with your shoes or your handbag. The Needler can only fire flechette rounds (already factored into its damage code). Wireless: You can change the color of the Tiffani Needler with a Minor Action. 

Streetline Special: Popular among society’s dregs, the Streetline Special is a small, lightweight weapon made of composite materials. Magnetic Anomaly Detectors suffer a –2 modifier to detect it.

Walther Palm Pistol: This is a classic double-barreled derringer in an over-under barrel combination. It packs a punch for its size, but on the downside it has one of the most diminutive “magazine” capacities on the market— just one bullet per barrel. Both barrels can be fired at once as a short burst.

**LIGHT PISTOLS**


Light pistols are highly accurate and fairly concealable, occupying a comfortable middle ground between Hold-outs and Heavy Pistols. They’re extremely common on the streets. Use the Pistols skill when firing a light pistol. Light pistols can take top- and barrel- mounted accessories.

Ares Light Fire 75: Designed based on one of the most common pistols on the market, the Light Fire is a weapon for special operators, not commonly available through legal channels. A special barrel-mounted silencer developed exclusively for the Light Fire comes attached, applying an additional –1 modifier to the modifier usually provided by silencers. In addition to its integral silencer, the Ares Light Fire 75 includes a smartgun system.

Ares Light Fire 70: The Ares Light Fire 70 is one of the most common pistols on the market. A special barrel-mounted silencer developed exclusively for the Light Fire 70 is available that gives you an additional –1 modifier to the usual –4 (for a total of –5); this silencer costs 750¥.

Beretta 201T: This light sidearm is used by many security professionals. It is capable of burst fire. Since the 201T is classified as a light pistol without further limitations, it is quite popular with security agencies in countries where heavy pistols and machine pistols are hard to come by legally. Semi-automatic bursts using the Beretta 201T require a Minor Action. The weapon includes a detachable shoulder stock.

Colt America L36: A venerable pistol with a great reputation. This basic firearm is cheap, easily concealed, and nearly ubiquitous. A perfect throwaway weapon.

Fichetti Security 600: A light sidearm for security forces, this weapon’s highly efficient feeding mechanism allows it a thirty-round magazine. The Fichetti Security 600 comes with a detachable folding stock and laser sight

Taurus Omni-6: This reliable, rugged revolver is specially designed to handle a wide variety of ammunition. Popular with hobbyists and hand-loaders, the Omni-6 comes with some interchangeable cylinders so it can take either cased or caseless, light pistol or heavy pistol ammo. When firing light pistol rounds, the Omni-6 is semi-automatic (SA) and has a base DV of 6P, and when it fires heavy pistol ammo it has only single shot mode (SS), and a base DV of 7P and –1 AP. The Omni-6 includes an integral laser sight.

**HEAVY PISTOLS**


Heavy pistols are powerful sidearms that are a good compromise between concealability and firepower. When you shoot a heavy pistol, you use the Pistols skill. Heavy pistols can take top- and barrel- mounted accessories

Ares Predator V: The newest iteration of the most popular handgun in the world, especially with mercenaries and shadowrunners. Upgraded with improved ergonomics and handling features, the Ares Predator V includes a smartgun system. Some say that the Ares Predator V isn’t better than other guns in its class, but no one can argue that it has better brand recognition.

Ares Viper Slivergun: The sleek Slivergun pairs the undeniably winning combo of burst-fire capability and built-in sound suppression (an integral silencer) with its large magazine capacity. It fires metal slivers that count as flechette ammunition, which is factored into the weapon’s damage code.

Browning Ultra-Power: This venerable sidearm is the Ares Predator’s primary competition as the world’s toughest heavy pistol. It offers a built-in top-mounted laser sight and is slightly cheaper

Colt Government 2066: This government-issue weapon, styled after the legendary Colt M1911a1, uses an electrically induced spark to detonate the bullet’s propellants. The removal of most moving parts from the firing mechanism gives this weapon a reputation for being exceptionally reliable.

Remington Roomsweeper: This is really more of a short-barreled shotgun than a pistol. When loaded with shot rounds (flechette) rather than solid slugs, it uses Heavy Pistol ranges but shotgun rules

Ruger Super Warhawk: This revolver is as loud as a jet liner and twice as shiny. It’s also one of the scariest handguns in the world. The cased ammo variant is popular for the sheer thrill of swinging open the cylinder gate one handed and dumping spent brass 

**MACHINE PISTOLS**


Machine pistols offer a high rate of fire in a compact package. Use the Automatics skill to fire a machine pistol (characters may use the Pistols skill in Semi-Auto mode). Machine pistols can take top- and barrel-mounted accessories.

Ares Crusader II: A large magazine and easy handling make the Ares Crusader II one of the most popular weapons of its class. It features an integral barrel-mounted gas-vent 2 recoil compensation system and comes with an integral smartgun system.

Ceska Black Scorpion: This classic machine pistol provides concealable burst-fire capability. It comes equipped with an integral folding stock.

Steyr TMP: This lightweight polymer-frame pistol is capable of full autofire, but its light weight makes it hard to control when firing on full auto. It comes equipped with a built-in top-mounted laser sight.

**SUBMACHINE GUNS**


Use the Automatics skill when firing a submachine gun.
SMGs can take top- and barrel-mounted accessories.

Colt Cobra TZ–120: With its unique design and wide range of accessories, the Colt Cobra series is quite popular both among security forces the world over and on the trids. The TZ–120 comes with a folding stock, top-mounted laser sight, and a barrel-mounted gas-vent 2 system.

FN P93 Praetor: This bullpup submachine gun was purpose-built for Corporate Court-controlled Interpol fast-response teams. Its special chamber system provides 1 point of Recoil Compensation, it has an integrated rigid stock, and a flashlight that can be used to reduce darkness penalties by one step (Environmental Modifiers). Possession of the FN P93 while not a legitimate member of a Corporate Court force is a crime in most jurisdictions.

HK–227: The SMG of choice for many corporate and military security forces, the HK–227 boasts a retractable stock, smartgun system, and integral sound suppressor

Ingram Smartgun X: Grade-A bang bang. Famous as the weapon of choice for many legendary street samurai since the 2050s, the Ingram Smartgun comes tricked out with a gas-vent 2 system, a smartgun system, and an integral sound suppressor

SCK Model 100: Shin Chou Kyogo is synonymous with Japanese corporate security. Nearly every Japanacorp’s security forces are issued the SCK 100, including Renraku’s infamous Red Samurai. The SCK 100 features an internal smartgun system and a folding stock.

Uzi IV: This aging submachine gun is a worthy descendant of the famous Israeli weapon. The SMG features an integral folding stock and built-in top-mounted laser sight.

**ASSAULT RIFLES**

Use the Automatics skill when firing an assault rifle. Assault rifles can take top-, barrel-, and underbarrel- mounted accessories.

AK-97: The AK-97 is a legendary weapon with storied reliability—you can bury it for ten years, dig it up, and fire it immediately without a single problem. When all of the nano-fabricated AK–174s melted to slag, the AK-97s kept functioning just fine.

Ares Alpha: Specially designed for Ares Firewatch special forces, the Alpha has since become a multi-platinum best-selling success the world over, seeing use with UCAS Special Forces. In part, this is due to its exceptional brand awareness, and also because of its underbarrel grenade launcher, smartgun system, and an expensive chamber design that provides 2 points of Recoil Compensation.

Colt M23: This cheap, mass-produced, no-frills assault rifle is loved both by the gangbangers and pirates who can manage to get their hands on one and by the pros who are looking for something to modify from the ground up.

FN HAR: This assault rifle is supremely popular with private security forces and corporate threat-response teams. It features a laser sight and a gas-vent 2 system

Yamaha Raiden: This electronic-firing assault rifle is state-of-the-art. The Raiden is very accurate and is quickly being adopted by japanacorp security forces and the Japanese Imperial Marines. It features an integral sound suppressor and smartgun system, and the electronic firing mechanism and design provides 1 point of Recoil Compensation.


**SNIPER RIFLES**


Use the Longarms skill when firing sniper rifles. Firearm enthusiasts will be the first to tell you that sport and hunting rifles are technically not sniper rifles, but they are similar enough in terms of game statistics to be included here rather than in their own section. Sniper rifles can take top, barrel-, and underbarrel-mounted accessories

Ares Desert Strike: This combat-hardened sniper rifle is intended for long-range shooting in harsh environments. That means it was built without materials or technologies prone to failure. It comes equipped with a rigid stock with shock pad and a detachable imaging scope.

Cavalier Arms Crockett EBR: Straddling the line between assault rifle and sniper rifle, the Crockett EBR features a burst fire mode. While it lacks the magazine capacity of a true assault rifle, and lacks the precision of a true marksman’s weapon, it makes up for this in versatility, being able to switch fluidly between a sniping role and a combat role as easy as flipping a switch. It comes equipped with a rigid stock with shock pad and a detachable imaging scope.

Ranger Arms SM–5: A legendary assassin’s weapon, this sniper rifle features a silencer, an imaging scope, and a rigid stock with shock pad. The SM–5 disassembles completely in order to fit into a standard briefcase; setting it up or breaking it down takes an `Extended Firearms + Logic [Mental] (6, Major Action)` Test. While deadly, the SM–5 is fragile. At the end of every Combat Turn in which the weapon is used in a running firefight, reduce its Accuracy by 1 (to a minimum of 3). If the weapon is used in combat as a melee weapon or to defend from a melee attack, reduce its Accuracy by 2 (again to a minimum of 3). Recalibrating the weapon (a one-hour job) returns its Accuracy to normal.

Remington 950: This high-powered bolt-action hunting rifle features classic wooden furniture and a top-mounted imaging scope that have kept it popular with hunters for several decades. It cannot mount underbarrel accessories.

Ruger 101: This futuristic-looking gas-operated sporting rifle is the favorite weapon for many professional hunters and hobbyists. It features a built-in imaging scope and a rigid stock with shock pad.

**SHOTGUNS**


Use the Longarms skill when firing shotguns. The stats for these shotguns are for normal slug rounds. When firing shot, use the special rules for shotguns, choke settings, and flechette ammo (Shotguns). Shotguns can take top, barrel, and underbarrel accessories.

Defiance T–250: A common sight on the mean streets when things escalate beyond pistols and knives, this semi-automatic shotgun is available in either a normal- length or short-barreled version. It is gas operated, but also features a secondary pump action for situations where preventing jams is more important than quickly firing a second shot. The short-barreled version has the Concealability of +4, the range of a heavy pistol, and a damage code of 9P.

Enfield AS-7: This military assault shotgun provides its user with massive firepower. As a close-quarters weapon and general combat gun, it is universally feared. It can either be loaded with ten-round ammo clips or a special twenty-four-round drum. The Enfield AS-7 comes equipped with a built-in, top-mounted laser sight

PJSS Model 55: This is a weapon of classic style for a classic sport. Produced only in small numbers, it’s renowned among European hunters and trap shooters as a precise and prestigious weapon. The weapon’s rigid stock comes equipped with an integrated shock pad. Both barrels can be shot at once as a short burst (see Not Enough Bullets).

**SPECIAL WEAPONS**


Use the Exotic Ranged Weapon skill when firing these weapons. This skill is not on the list of skills it can be added **if someone wants to use one of these wacky weapons**.

Ares S-III Super Squirt: This popular non-lethal weapon fires DMSO gel packs. The dimethyl sulfoxide forces the skin to absorb the chemicals the operator wishes to deliver. The attack itself causes no damage, but when the target is hit successfully, the DMSO delivers the substance directly into the target’s bloodstream as a Contact vector toxin (Toxins, Drugs, and BTLs). The Super Squirt uses Light Pistol ranges and can accept top- and underbarrel-mounted accessories

Fichetti Pain Inducer: For a non-lethal weapon, the Fichetti Pain Inducer is not very humane. It makes someone feel like they are in a microwave, roasting from the inside out. Treat this as a toxin attack with a Power of 8 and a speed of Immediate. The target resists with Body + Willpower. If the modified Power exceeds the target’s Mental limit, the target must spend his next Action Phase doing whatever it takes to run away from the pain. The attacker can continue to hold her beam on a target with a Major Action unless the gamemaster deems the target has dodged away or found cover. If the target cannot get out of the beam, he is incapacitated with pain, suffering a modifier equal to the modified Power on all tests for as long as the beam is trained on him. The Pain Inducer uses SMG ranges and can take top and underbarrel accessories. It has ten charges; when attached to a power point, it reloads one charge every ten seconds. Wireless: The Pain Inducer recharges by induction at a rate of 1 charge per hour

Parashield Dart Pistol: The industry standard dart pistol, this fires injection darts with narcoject or another payload. The Parashield dart pistol uses Heavy Pistol ranges and can take top-mounted accessories. Wireless: The dart reports whether or not it has struck home and successfully injected. It may also report any gross physical anomalies in the target’s tissue, although its medical sensors are not very sophisticated (Device Rating of 1 for the dart).

Parashield Dart Rifle: Originally designed to non-lethally take down large game animals at long ranges, the Parashield dart rifle uses compressed air cartridges to fire injection darts. This weapon includes a top-mounted imaging scope. It uses sporting rifle ranges and can mount top and underbarrel accessories. Wireless: The dart reports whether or not it has struck home and successfully injected. It may also report any gross physical anomalies in the target’s tissue, although its medical sensors are not very sophisticated (Device Rating of 1 for the dart).

**MACHINE GUNS**


Machine guns come in three varieties—light, medium, and heavy—that determine their ranges. All, even the “light” ones, are in fact very heavy and large. A light machine gun is physically bigger and heavier than an assault rifle. MMGs and HMGs could be carried by someone with Strength of 8+ and 10+ (respectively), but they work better as vehicle-mounted weapons.

Use the Heavy Weapons skill when firing these weapons. They suffer from double modifiers for uncompensated recoil (Recoil). Machine guns can take top, barrel, and underbarrel accessories.

Ingram Valiant: This legendary light machine gun is popular with mercenary units the world over. It comes with a rigid stock with shock pad, a laser sight, and a barrel-mounted gas-vent 2 system.

Stoner-Ares M202: This MMG packs a tremendous punch into a relatively lightweight framework made of extra-durable compounds. Due to its relatively small size, it’s a very popular secondary weapon for heavy military vehicles. Trolls with no concept of subtlety sometimes deck them out with accessories for use as personal weapons.

RPK HMG: This heavy Russian machine gun is used by the militaries of several eastern European and Near East countries, primarily as a vehicle-mounted support weapon. Equipped with a detachable tripod, the RPK is usually fired from a prone, sitting, or kneeling position when not mounted on a vehicle.

**CANNONS & LAUNCHERS**


Use the Heavy Weapons skill when firing assault cannons and grenade and missile launchers. All suffer from double modifiers for uncompensated recoil. Both assault cannons and launchers can take top and underbarrel accessories. Naturally, assault cannons use assault cannon ammo, grenade launchers fire minigrenades, and missile launchers launch missiles or rockets.

Ares Antioch–2: The Antioch–2 features a classic grenade launcher design combined with an integral smartlink system. It is one of the more affordable grenade launchers on the market. Wireless: You can use the wireless link trigger for your grenades, even if you don’t have DNI (Direct Neural Interface).

ArmTech MGL–12: This bullpup-configuration grenade launcher is popular, since it can fire in semi-auto mode and carries substantially more minigrenades than its competitors. Wireless: You can use the wireless link trigger for your grenades, even if you don’t have DNI (Direct Neural Interface).

Aztechnology Striker: The Striker is an extremely light disposable launcher—perfect when you want to deliver a punch and make a quick, unencumbered getaway. Wireless: You can use the wireless link trigger for your missiles, even if you don’t have DNI (Direct Neural Interface).

Krime Cannon: Krime may be a small-time manufacturer, but their assault cannon, simply called the Cannon, is a cheap heavy weapon big on attitude and firepower. It comes standard with modification for trolls, and so is the first weapon in the Sixth World to be intended for larger customers.

Onotari Interceptor: This Saeder-Krupp-developed military missile launcher is designed to fire rockets or guided missiles, of any type. It has two separate barrels and firing chambers, and can load up to two missiles at once, which need not be of the same type. Due to backblast issues, it is not capable of “giving ‘em both barrels.” It features an internal smartgun system.Wireless: You can use the wireless link trigger for your missiles, even if you don’t have DNI (Direct Neural Interface).

Panther XXL: This huge fragging gun is an assault cannon that uses ammunition similar to the primary weapon in many small tanks. It comes with a built-in smartgun system.


### Firearm Accessesories

Most firearm accessories must be attached to a particular mount—top, barrel, underbarrel. Each mount can only hold one accessory at a time.

Airburst link: This grenade/rocket launcher smartgun accessory uses a “smart” rangefinder to air-burst the explosive projectile at a point deemed to be both a safe distance from the launcher and within the closest possible proximity to the target. An airburst link reduces the scatter distance for a launched grenade by two yards per net hit instead of by one yard per hit (Determine Scatter) when you use the wireless link trigger. Wireless: An airburst link requires wireless functionality to function at all. Both the grenades and the launcher must have wireless mode turned on.

Bipod: This two-legged brace extends downward from the weapon, allowing it to be fired low to the ground with the user in a prone or sitting position. A bipod can be attached to the underbarrel mount of a weapon and provides 2 points of Recoil Compensation when properly deployed. Attaching a bipod takes one minute. Folding up or deploying a bipod is a Minor Action. Removing it is a Major Action. Wireless: Folding up or deploying the bipod is a Free Action

Concealable holster: This small holster can be worn on the ankle, clipped to the forearm, in the small of the back, or anywhere else it’s unlikely to be seen. The concealable holster adds –1 to the item’s Concealability. Only pistols and tasers fit in a Concealable Holster. Wireless: Wireless sensors and a smart-fabric coated weave allow the holster to alter color and texture in real time adding an additional –1 to the item’s Concealability.

Gas-vent system: Gas-vent recoil compensation systems are barrel-mounted accessories that vent a weapon’s barrel gases at a specific vector to counter muzzle climb. Once installed, a gas-vent cannot be removed. Gas-vent systems provide a number of points of Recoil Compensation equal to their rating.

Gyro mount: This heavy upper-body harness features an attached, articulated, motorized gyro-stabilized arm that mounts an assault rifle or a heavy weapon. The system neutralizes up to 6 points of recoil and movement modifiers. Attaching or removing a weapon from the mount takes a Minor Action. Putting on a gyro-mount harness takes about five minutes, while the quick-release allows you to get out of it with a Major Action. Wireless: Activating the harness’s quick-release with a wireless signal to exit the harness is a Free Action.

Hidden arm slide: Attached to the forearm and worn under clothing, this slide can accommodate a pistol- sized weapon. It can fit a hold-out, light pistol, or taser. With a hand gesture, the slide releases the weapon/ object right into your hand. If you quick draw the weapon in this slide, the Threshold for the quick draw is Threshold 18. It also gives the weapon a –1 Concealability modifier. Wireless: You can ready the weapon in the slide as a Free Action.

Imaging scope: These classic scopes are attached to the top mount; attaching or removing them takes only a Minor Action. Imaging scopes include a micro camera and vision magnification, and they have a Capacity of 3 to hold vision enhancements. Wireless: The scope’s “line of sight” can be shared, allowing you to share what your scope sees with your team (and yourself if you’re using it to look around a corner).

Laser sight: This device uses a laser beam to project a visible dot (in your choice of colors) on the target. This increases the weapon’s Accuracy by 1, which is not cumulative with smartlink modifiers. The laser sight can be attached to either the underbarrel mount or top mount. Activating or deactivating a laser sight is a Minor Action. Wireless: The wireless laser sight provides a +1 modifier on attack tests, not cumulative with smartlink modifiers. Activating and deactivating the laser sight is a Free Action.

Periscope: This adjustable “off-axis” viewer attaches to a top mount and allows an operator to target a weapon around corners, reducing the usual –3 modifier to –2. A periscope can be upgraded with any of the vision enhancements noted on Wireless: The modifier for shooting around corners is reduced to –1.

Quick-draw holster: This easy access holster can hold any weapon of Machine Pistol or smaller size. It reduces the Threshold for quick-drawing the holstered weapon by 1.

Shock pad: A shock-absorbing pad is situated on the rigid stock of a rifle, shotgun, or heavy weapon, and provides 1 point of recoil compensation

Silencer/suppressor: This barrel-mounted accessory reduces the sound and flash of a weapon’s discharge. It cannot be used with revolvers or shotguns. It applies a –4 modifier on all Perception Tests to notice the weapon’s use or locate the weapon’s firer. Attaching or removing a silencer takes a Major Action. Wireless: The silencer/suppressor features a Rating 2 microphone with Rating 2 Select Sound Filter and simple software that alerts you via AR if your silencer detects the sound of someone nearby reacting to the sound of the silenced weapon.

Smart firing platform: This is a non-mobile robotic tripod equipped with a remote control pivot that allows for a 180-degree firing arc and a 60-degree inclination. You can mount one smartgun-equipped weapon to the platform, and it will be fired by the device’s onboard Pilot (Device Rating 3). The platform is equipped with a Targeting Autosoft (Rating 3) and can be upgraded with additional autosofts, usually a Clearsight program. You need to set the parameters of who exactly the platform should and shouldn’t shoot at, which are followed by the platform’s pilot. The platform provides 5 points of Recoil Compensation. It has an Initiative attribute of Pilot x 2 and 4D6 Initiative Dice when acting autonomously. Wireless: You can fire the mounted weapon remotely, like a drone with no rigger interface. You can use an implanted smartlink with the smartgun if you’re in VR.

Smartgun system: This connects a firearm or a projectile weapon directly to the user’s smartlink. Incorporating a small camera and laser range finder, the smartlink keeps track of ammunition, heat buildup, and material stress. If you have a smartlink, you can mentally switch between gun modes, eject a clip, and fire the gun without pulling the trigger. The camera lets you shoot around corners without exposing yourself to return fire (at a –3 modifier). The system makes use of advanced calculation software, allowing for precisely calculated trajectories and high precision over any distance.

If you’re using a smartlink, the smartgun system increases the gun’s Accuracy by 2. The smartgun features are accessed either by universal access port cable to an imaging device (like glasses, goggles, or a datajack for someone with cybereyes) or by a wireless connection working in concert with direct neural interface. Retrofitting a firearm with an internal smartgun system doubles the weapon’s price and adds 2 to its Availability. An external smartgun system can be attached to the top mount or underbarrel mount with an `Armorer + Logic (4, 1 hour)` Extended Test. The small camera has a capacity of 1 and can be equipped with vision enhancements. Wireless: A wireless smartlink provides a modifier to all attacks with the weapon: +1 if you’re using gear with a smartlink or +2 if you’re using an augmentation for which you paid Essence. Ejecting a clip and changing fire modes are Free Actions

Spare clip: A spare clip comes unloaded but can hold the maximum rounds for the weapon. Each clip is specific to the weapon you buy it for, but they all cost the same. And yes, it’s technically a detachable box magazine, but the Cityspeak word for it is so popular these days that even the catalogs call them clips

Speed loader: The speed loader is a simple device that holds a ring of bullets for fast insertion into a revolver’s cylinder. Each speed loader is specific to the weapon it was designed for. It lets you fully reload a revolver as a Minor Action instead of having to load rounds one at a time as a Major Action.

Tripod: The tripod provides a stable base to fire a weapon low to the ground with the user kneeling or sitting. A tripod can be attached to the underbarrel mount and provides 6 points of Recoil Compensation when properly deployed. Attaching a tripod takes one minute. Folding up or deploying the bipod is a Free Action. Wireless: Folding up, deploying, or removing the tripod is a Free Action.

### Ammunition

Ammunition is defined by type (regular, gel, APDS, etc.), class of ammo is exchangeable with the other ammo of its type. Meaning all Clips (c) can fit any Clip firearm, all internal magazines (m) fit all internal magazines, every muzzel loader ammo fits any other etc.

APDS rounds: These are military-grade armor piercing rounds—their full name is armor piercing discarding sabot. They are designed to travel at high velocities and punch through personal body armor. Assault cannon rounds: These are for assault cannons only, and they’re the only thing assault cannons can load.

Explosive rounds: These slugs carry a shaped-charge explosive, designed to explode and fragment on impact. Explosive rounds misfire whenever you roll a critical glitch. When this happens, you must resist one “attack” with a Damage Value equal to the normal damage done by the weapon (and don’t forget the modifier for the explosive rounds). The attack misses its intended target, and the weapon firing the bullets is destroyed.

Flechette rounds: The payload of a flechette round is made up of tiny, tightly packed metal slivers. The round breaks up and shatters on impact, becoming a tumbling hail of shrapnel. Flechette rounds are devastating against unprotected targets, but not as effective against hardened armor.

Gel rounds: These less-lethal rounds use a hard, jelly-like substance that is a safer alternative to rubber bullets. They are often employed for riot control. Their usually semi-rigid slugs flatten on impact, disbursing their kinetic energy over a larger-than-normal area. Gel rounds inflict Stun damage (AP +1). Gel rounds give the target Disadvantage against being knocked prone (see Resist Knockdown)

Hollow point rounds: Hollow point or dum dum rounds have their tips indented, so they are designed to “mushroom” or expand on impact, becoming a hail of deadly fragments not unlike flechettes, although hollow points are a much older technology. Like flechettes, hollow points work better on unarmored targets and tend to flatten against armor.

Injection darts: For use with dart guns of various types, like the Parashield pistol and rifle. Each injection dart carries a single dose of a drug or toxin (sold separately). The effect of the dart depends on the drug payload, but to successfully deliver that payload, the attack with the dart must get at least one net hit against an unarmored target or three net effect against a target with armor. This is an injection vector toxin attack.

Regular ammo: Also called ball or full metal jacket rounds, these solid slugs are useful for numerous applications (mainly killing things).

Stick-n-Shock: Stick-n-Shock rounds deal electrical Stun damage of equal to the damage of the base weapon –2. They have a flat AP of –5 that replaces the weapon’s AP instead of stacking with it.

Tracer rounds: Tracer ammo burns along the line of flight, making it easier for the shooter to home in on the target. This type of ammunition can only be used in Full Auto weapons and, being loaded as every third round in a clip, is an exception to the restriction of one type of ammunition per clip. They improve the Accuracy of your gun by 1 when you fire more than one round in an Action Phase (cumulative with a laser sight but not a smartgun).

Taser dart: These darts are designed to be loaded into taser weapons

**GRENADES**


Grenades are small, self-contained explosive packages. Minigrenades are grenades specifically designed for use with grenade launchers, set to arm when they have traveled 5 yards from their point of origin and explode on impact (unless using an airburst link). This safety feature can be disabled with an `Demolitions + Logic [Mental] (12,4, 5 Minutes) Extended Test`. Minigrenades have the same cost and effects as standard grenades. Use the Throwing Weapons skill when throwing grenades, or Heavy Weapons when launching a grenade from a grenade launcher. Follow the rules for Grenades. Grenades and similar explosives can also be rigged with a tripwire to set up as a basic booby-trap. This requires an `Extended Demolitions + Logic [Mental] (12, 8, 1 Major Action) Test`. In addition to any other wireless bonus, all grenades have the following wireless feature (use it with caution): Wireless: You can use the wireless link trigger for your grenades, even if you don’t have DNI (Direct Neural Interface).

Flash-bang grenades: Upon detonation, these “concussion” or “stun” grenades explode to create a bright, loud, shocking blast distributed equally over a radius of 10 yards.

Flash-pak: Not a grenade per se, this is an electronic unit the size of a pack of cigarettes containing four quartz-halogen micro-flashes designed to fire in random strobing sequence to blind opponents. Anyone looking in the direction of a flash-pak receives a –4 modifier on attack tests due to the strobing (flare compensation goggles, glasses, etc. reduce this modifier to –2, while flare compensation in cybereyes or as a retinal modification reduces this modifier to –1). The flash-pak has 10 charges; when activated it uses one charge per Combat Turn. When plugged in, it recharges one charge every 10 seconds. Wireless: The strobe sequence can avoid directing strong flashes at the subscribed character; they suffer only half glare penalties from the flash-pak, rounded down. It can recharge by induction, regaining one charge per hour.

Fragmentation grenade: These classic killing devices are designed to spread a cloud of deadly shrapnel over a large area, seriously injuring soft targets.

High-explosive grenade: These grenades are designed to deliver a large blast and concentrated hurt.

Gas Grenade: Instead of exploding, the gas grenade releases a cloud of gas over an area with a radius of 10 yards. This is usually riot control/CS gas, but many other chemical or toxin payloads can be chosen (Toxins, Drugs, and BTLs). The cloud lasts for approximately 4 Combat Turns (less in windy areas, longer in confined areas with poor ventilation, at the gamemaster’s discretion).

Smoke: Similar to the gas grenade, a smoke grenade releases a cloud of smoke over an area with a diameter of 10 yards. The cloud obscures vision, applying visibility modifiers for smoke to relevant tests. The cloud lasts for approximately 4 Combat Turns (less in windy areas, longer in confined areas with poor ventilation, at the gamemaster’s discretion).

Thermal smoke: Identical to a smoke grenade, except that the smoke contains hot particles designed to obscure thermographic vision. Apply the visibility modifiers for thermal smoke. The cloud lasts for approximately 4 Combat Turns (less in windy areas, longer in confined areas with poor ventilation, at the GM’s discretion).

**ROCKETS AND MISSILES**


Rockets are projectiles consisting of a light metal or plastic body with stabilizing fins, a propulsion system (usually solid-chemical) and a warhead. Missiles are rockets that carry internal guidance systems, making them more expensive than standard “dumb” rockets.

Rules for firing rockets and missiles are in the Rules chapter Rockets and missiles are set to arm when they have traveled 10 yards from their point of origin and explode on impact. This safety feature can be disabled with an Demolitions + Logic [Mental] (12,4, 5 Minutes) Extended Test. In addition to any other wireless bonus, all rockets and missiles have the following wireless feature: Wireless: You can use the wireless link trigger for your rocket or missile, even if you don’t have DNI (Direct Neural Interface).

Anti-vehicle: AV rockets/missiles contain a shapedcharge warhead designed to burn or punch its way through a vehicle or barrier. Though the impact causes a blast, it is limited compared to that of a High-Explosive projectile. AV attacks have an AP of –10 against vehicles and barriers, –4 against other targets.

Fragmentation: Used principally against people, the warhead discharges high-speed metal or plastic-metal fragments designed to tear into unprotected flesh. These rockets/missiles are very effective against unprotected individuals, but fairly ineffective against barriers, structures, and vehicles.

High explosive: HE rockets/missiles are designed to do heavy damage to a large area. Their blast pattern is similar to that of a grenade, but much larger. They are not particularly effective against hardened targets, such as vehicles or protected military structures. HE weapons use the standard grenade rules for determining the blast and its effects

Explosives are primarily used to damage structures. You can use the Demolitions skill to prepare explosives, identify key or weak structural points, and focus the blast. Each Effect on a `Demolitions + Logic [Mental] Test` adds 1 to the explosive’s effective rating. See Barriers, for calculating an explosive’s effect on a barrier.

> Shadowrun really jumped the shark 2e and beyond with square roots and making this insanely complicated. This is Sixfinity not Shadowrun.


All explosives do `Rating * 3 Explosive Damage` they lose 1 rating per Yard (or square) from the origin point.

Commercial explosives: A range of explosive compounds, both solid and liquid, are available to the construction industry for all their destructive needs.

Plastic explosives: These highly stable moldable, and adhesive explosive compounds are military grade. They’re ideal for certain jobs, like breaching walls. They are usually color-tinted to indicate the level of current needed to detonate them, from the black of magnetic- field induction to the chalky white of 440-volt industrial explosives.

Explosive foam: Plastic explosives with the consistency of shaving cream, stored in an aerosol can. Perfect for spraying into crevices, and detonated the same way as regular plastic explosives.

Detonator cap: This detonator is inserted into a mass of explosives and set off either by a programmable timer or radio signal. Setting the timer takes a Major Action. Wireless: You can set the detonator’s timer with a Minor Action. You can also set it off without a countdown as a Free Action.

### Clothing and Armor

In 2075, you’d have to be crazy to consider walking outside with just a tee-shirt and jeans, even in some of the nicer parts of the Sprawl. You need protection: from the acid rain, from air pollution, from ultraviolet radiation from the completely fragged ozone layer, and of course, from random street violence.

#### Clothing Descriptions

Clothing: Clothing in 2075 comes with amazing features you’ll likely completely take for granted. Commlinks, music players, and other electronic devices can be woven right into the fabric, powered by interwoven batteries or special energy-gathering fabrics. On the other side of the economy, cheap soybased “flats” can be had for five nuyen per article of clothing from vending machines around the Sprawl. The more money you spend on your threads, the more impressive you look.

Electrochromic clothing: Electrochromic threads can change color with voltage, letting you alter the color of your clothing or display text, images, or patterns. This is good for fashion, but great for vanishing into a crowd if you need a quick costume change. You can even get armored clothing in electrochromic styles. It takes a Minor Action to change the settings on your electrochromic clothes, but a couple of Combat Turns to complete the change.

Wireless: Changing your clothes’ settings is a Free Action, and while it’s not good enough to be camouflage, it can display images, text files, or flat video from your commlink.

Feedback clothing: This haptic clothing allows for a tactile component to an augmented reality experience. 

Leather jacket/duster: Usually made of synthleather unless you’ve got mad nuyen, this type of jacket (waist-length to duster) never goes out of style and even offers a modicum of protection. Just don’t expect it to stop bullets.

#### Armor Descriptions

Actioneer Business Clothes: A discreetly armored
“power suit” is a popular choice among Mr. Johnsons,
faces, and fixers looking for a little high-class protection
coupled with style. It features a concealable holster
(Firearm Accessories, p. 431) in the jacket.

Armor clothing: Lightweight ballistic fiber weave
makes these garments almost impossible to detect as
armor. It doesn’t provide as much protection as real armor,
but it’s available in a wide variety of styles.

Armor jacket: The most popular armor solution on
the streets comes in all styles imaginable. It offers good
protection without catching too much attention. But
don’t think of wearing one to a dinner party.

Armor vest: This modern flexible-wrap vest is designed
to be worn under regular clothing without displaying
any bulk. A popular and cost-effective option.

Chameleon suit: This full-body suit has a smart ruthenium
polymer coating supported by a sensor suite; the
technology allows it to scan its surroundings and replicate
the images at the proper perspectives. Add 2 to your
limit when you make Sneaking tests to hide. A chameleon
suit is also armored for the wearer’s protection.

Wireless: The suit uses the extra information about
your surroundings and also gives you a +2 dice pool bonus
to Sneaking Tests for hiding.

Full body armor: Impossible to conceal, this armor is
worn by military and security personnel around the world
for heavy ops duty. It is styled for intimidation as well as
ease of movement, with a full array of tactical holsters,
pouches, and webbing, and is certain to draw attention.
The suit can be modified for environmental adaptation (hot
or cold environments) or chemically sealed to completely
protect the wearer from toxic environments and attacks.
The suit’s helmet has a Capacity of 6 for the purpose of
being equipped with vision or audio enhancements.
Lined coat: This Wild West style duster has been
consistently popular on the mean streets of the world’s
sprawls for the past thirty years. Besides its protective
traits, the armored trenchcoat provides an additional –2
Concealability modifier to items hidden underneath.
Urban Explorer Jumpsuit: Designed for couriers,
athletes, and freerunners, these colorful jumpsuits are
well ventilated and breathable but surprisingly protective
with lightweight densiplast and liquid reactive armor.
Urban explorer jumpsuits feature a built-in music
player and biomonitor.

##### ARMOR MODIFICATIONS

Any piece of worn armor can be upgraded with a range of modifications. The Capacity of a piece of armor is equal to its Armor Rating. Armor modifications have variable Capacity costs. Each modification also has a rating between 1 and 6, except as noted.

Chemical protection: Water-resistant, non-porous, impermeable materials, and a coating of neutralizing agents protect the wearer against contact-vector chemical attacks (Toxins, Drugs and BTLs). Add the rating of the Chemical Protection modification to tests made to resist contact-vector toxin attacks.

Chemical seal: Available only to full body armor that includes a helmet, the chemical seal is an airtight environmental control that takes a Major Action to activate (if you’re already wearing the armor, natch). It provides complete protection against contact and inhalation vector chemicals, but can only be used for a total of an hour (the limit of the air supply) at a time.

Wireless: Activating the chemical seal is a Free Action.

Fire resistance: Fire-retardant, nonflammable materials protect the wearer against Fire damage. Add the full rating of the Fire Resistance modification to the Armor value when resisting Fire attacks or checking if the armor catches fire.

Insulation: Thermal fibers and heat-retentive materials protect the wearer against Cold damage. Add the full rating of the Insulation modification to the Armor value when resisting Cold attacks.

Nonconductivity: Electrical insulation and non-conductive materials protect the wearer against Electricity damage. Add the full rating of this modification to the Armor value when resisting Electricity attacks.

Shock frills: These strips of “fur” are electrically charged when activated, standing on end and inflicting Electricity damage to anyone that touches you. Use Unarmed Combat to attack with the frills. The frills hold 10 charges; when attached to a power point, they recharge one charge per 10 seconds. Wireless: The shock frills can be activated or deactivated as a Free Action. They can also recharge by induction, recharging one charge per hour.

Thermal damping: Designed to reduce your thermal signature, these inner layers capture or bleed heat, so the outer layers maintain a surface temperature equal to the surrounding air. Add the rating to your limit on any Sneaking test against thermographic vision or thermal sensors. Wireless: The suit uses the extra information about your surroundings and also gives you its rating as a dice pool bonus to Sneaking tests against heat-based detection.

#### HELMETS AND SHIELDS

Instead of counting as separate pieces of armor, helmets and shield modify the rating of worn armor by their Rating (Armor and Encumbrance). Due to the awkwardness of holding a shield, if you’re using one you take a –1 modifier to your Physical limit when you do something where the shield might get in the way (though not attacks made using the shield as a weapon). Shields may be upgraded with the chemical protection, fire resistance, and nonconductivity armor modifications and have a Capacity equal to their Armor Rating for this purpose.

Helmet: Helmets come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes and protect your noggin from trauma. Helmets have Capacity 6 for being tricked out with accessories like trode nets and vision enhancements.

Ballistic shield: This large opaque shield is used by SWAT teams and in urban combat. It features a clear plastic window and a built-in ladder frame along the inside so that it can be used to climb over small obstacles.

Riot shield: As an added crowd control measure, a riot shield can be used to shock anyone who comes into contact with it, inflicting Electricity damage. The taser shield holds 10 charges; when attached to a power point, it regains one charge per 10 seconds. Wireless: The riot shield recharges by induction, recharging one charge per hour.

Commlinks are universal communication devices; they’re used by everyone all the time. Commlinks are essentially the digital Swiss army knives of the modern world. Even the most basic of them includes AR Matrix browsing capability, multiple telephone and radio modes of real-time talk and text, music players, micro trid-projectors, touchscreen displays, built in high-resolution digital video and still image cameras, image/text and RFID tag scanners, built-in GPS guidance systems, chip players, credstick readers, retractable earbuds, voice-access dialing, textto-speech and speech-to-text technologies, and a shock and water resistant case. And all of this at an inexpensive price that a few decades ago would have seemed absurd.

Sim Module: This commlink upgrade gives you the simsense experience, translating computer data into neural signals that allow you to directly experience simsense programs and augmented reality. A sim module must be accessed via a direct neural interface (trodes, datajack, or implanted commlink). Sim modules are a must-have for virtual reality of sorts, including VR clubs, VR games, simsense, and darker virtual pleasures. Sim modules can be modified for hot-sim, which opens up the full (and dangerous) range of VR experiences.

## Chapter 8: Combat

Combat Step By Step

1. Determine Surprise
2. Establish Positions
3. Determine Initiative
4. Take Turns
5. Move to next Round

### Surprise

A band of runners sneaks up on a a group of guards. A hell hound sneaks down an officer hallway, unnoticed by the runners until the hell hound engulfs one of them in flame. In these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other.

The GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the GM compares the Agility  (Sneaking) tests of anyone hiding with the passive Intuition (Perception) [`10 + Intuition`] score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or critter that doesn’t notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.

If you’re surprised, you can’t move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can’t take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren’t.

### Initiative

Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When com⁠bat starts, every participant makes a Initiative Test `3D6 + (Reaction + Intution) + Initiative Die` for personal combat, other types of combat have different Initiative Tests on the table below, to determine their place in the initiative order. The GM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time.

The GM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This is the order (called the initiative order) in which they act during each round. The initiative order remains the same from round to round.

If a tie occurs, the DM decides the order among tied DM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters. The GM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character. Optionally, the GM can have the tied characters and monsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first; or have them go simultaneously.

**Initiative Table**

| Initiative Type | Initiative Test                         |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Personal Combat | (Reaction + Intuition) + Initiative Die |
| Astral Combat   | Inuition x 2 + Initiative Die           |
| Cybercombat     | (Reaction + Intuition) + Initiative Die |


#### Timed Items & Initiative

Unless the item allows a timer to be set, in which case the player can determine when, these items go off at the end of the players turn.

### Movement and Position

In combat, characters and NPC's are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand.

On your turn if you use a Dash you can use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following the rules here.

Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can constitute your entire move. However you're moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.

#### Breaking Up Your Move

You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your another action. For example, if you have a speed of 10 yards, you can move 2 yards, take your action, and then move 8 yards.

#### Difficult Terrain

Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains.

Furniture-strewn offices, rubble filled streets, treacherous staircases—the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.

Every yard of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra yard. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.

Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.

#### Being Prone

Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are prone, a condition described in the appendix.

You can drop prone without using any of your speed. Standing up takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to one third your speed. For example, if your speed is 10 yards, you must spend 3 yards of movement to stand up. You can't stand up if you don't have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.

To move while prone, you must crawl or use magic. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra yard. Crawling 1 yard in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 yards of movement.

#### Moving around Other Creatures

You can move through a nonhostile creature's space. In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature's space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature's space is difficult terrain for you.

Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can't willingly end your move in its space.

If you leave a hostile creature's reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained later in the chapter.


### Action In Combat

The Action economy of Sixfinity is mare structured than the economy in Shadowrun. 

When the action picks up and the game moves into taking turns in initiative order, it’s good to know how much time is passing and what you can do in that time.

When you get to take a turn and describe what your character is doing, your actions are contained in a combat round. A combat round lasts for about three seconds of in-universe time. Everyone, player characters and non-player characters alike, take a single player turn within that round.

Each combat round, you gain an action allotment that you use on your player turn. Actions come in two categories: Minor and Major. The basic action allotment for each character is 1 Minor Action and 1 Major Action per combat round. Players get 1 additional Minor Action for every Initiative Die they have. Players can trade Minor and Major Actions, using a Major Action to perform a Minor Action or using 4 Minor Actions to perform a Major Action (possibly providing an extra attack in a single player turn). Each action has a note next to it indicating when it can be performed; this is either Initiative (I) or Anytime (A). Initiative Actions can only be performed on the character’s player turn during an initiative round, while Anytime Actions can be used at any time. Note, though, that in order to perform an Anytime Action, you must have an Action left. If you spent them all on your turn, you can’t use one later. So sometimes it pays to save an action for later in the round if you act early. Note that actions cannot be carried from one round to another unless that is specifically allowed in a rule.

Along with these actions, enough words can be spoken or conversation can be shared to fill three seconds; if there is any doubt about the amount of words that can be said, time it!

Every **combat round** a character gets:
- 1 Major Action and 1 Minor Actions



#### Minor Actions
These actions usually take only a small amount of focus or a quick and simple thought or movement. A key point among Minor Actions is that they generally do not require a test of any kind. That doesn’t mean in truly dire situations where the pressure is on that the gamemaster can’t ask for a test to be made—it just means that usually, as long as you have the action available, you can perform the task by simply declaring the use of it.

| Minor Actions                 |
| ----------------------------- |
| Activate/Deactivate Focus (I) |
| Attack of Opportunity (A)     |
| Block (A)                     |
| Change Device Mode (A)        |
| Command Drone (I)             |
| Command Spirit (I)            |
| Dismiss Spirit (A)            |
| Dodge (A)                     |
| Drop Object (A)               |
| Drop Prone  (I)               |
| Move (I)                      |
| Multiple Attacks (I)          |
| Quick Draw (I)                |
| Reload Smartgun (I)           |
| Shift Perception (I)          |
| Stand Up (I)                  |
| Take Cover  (I)               |
| Trip (I)                      |

##### Activate (Deactivate) Focus (I)

A character can activate or deactivate a bonded focus that they are carrying on their person with a Minor Action.

##### Attack of Opportunity (A)

When an enemy leaves your threatened area you may make an immediate melee attack on them as long as you have a Minor Action available to you.

##### Block (A)

A character can add their Close Combat skill to their melee defense. This lasts until they are attacked or their next turn

##### Change Device Mode (A)

A character may use a Minor Action to activate, deactivate, or switch the mode on any device that they are linked to by a direct neural interface, be it a wired or wireless link. This includes activating or deactivating cyberware, changing a smartgun’s firing settings, switching a commlink to hidden mode, turning a device’s wireless functionality off, and so on

##### Command Drone (I)

A character may issue a command to a drone they control. If multiple drones are controlled through a rigger command console (RCC), the same command can be issued to every drone. If a different command is desired for each drone, it requires multiple Minor Actions.

##### Command Spirit (I)

A character may issue a service command to a single spirit or group of spirits under their control, or dismiss them. The service must be the same. If multiple services are desired, multiple Minor Actions must be used.

##### Dismiss Spirit (A)

A character may dismiss their spirit at any time with a Minor Action.

##### Dodge (A)

A character can add their Athletics skill to their ranged Defense. This lasts until they are attacked or their next turn.

##### Drop Object (A)

A character may drop an object they are holding in their hand or hands as a single Minor Action. The objects fall to the ground and may suffer damage or ill effects if the gamemaster so chooses, depending on the distance of the fall and the landing spot.

##### Drop Prone (I)

A character may choose to drop themselves to the ground as a Minor Action. They gain the Prone status until they choose to use the Stand Up Action.

##### Move (I)

A character can use this Minor Action for 10 yards of movement. Only one Move Action is allowed per player turn.

##### Multiple Attacks (I)

A character can attack more than one opponent, assuming ammunition, reach, and enemy placement allow it. Split your modifier evenly among all targets rounded down. This action must be used in conjunction with an Attack Major Action.

##### Quick Draw (I)
A character may quick draw a pistol, pistol- sized weapon, or small throwing weapon and immediately attack with this Minor Action. The Attack action must be used in conjunction with this action. They must have the appropriate gear, augmentation, or quality to be allowed this action— if they don’t have something that allows this action, they can’t take it.

##### Reload Smartgun (I)

A character linked to a ready smartgun may use a mental command to eject the weapon’s clip while sliding a new one in with one deft motion, assuming that the new ammo is readily available.

##### Shift Perception (I)

A character capable of Astral Perception may shift perception to or from astral space as a Minor Action

##### Stand Up (I)

Whether they chose to be prone or they got knocked down, a character uses this action to get back to their feet and remove the Prone status

##### Take Aim (I)

A character gains a +1 bonus edge bonus with the use of this action. The action can only be taken once per combat round, but if the bonus is not used, it carries over to the next combat round, allowing it to be combined with actions taken over the course of several combat rounds. If the character takes a player turn without taking the Take Aim or Attack actions, any carryover bonuses from previous rounds are lost. The maximum bonus edge from the use of this action is equal to the character’s Willpower. A character may take aim with a ready firearm, bow, or exotic ranged weapon.

If the character is using vision magnification or a targeting scope, the Take Aim action must be used to line up the shot in order to receive any bonus from the item. In this case, the first action of Take Aim does not provide any additional bonus beyond enabling the function of the modification.

##### Take Cover (I)

The character uses something in their area to provide protection, but they also must operate from the constraints created by the cover. Taking cover gives the player the Cover I, II, III, or IV status

#### Major Actions

These actions take a bit more concentration or time to complete. Several involve a test of some kind, but some simply occur as long as you have the Action available. Just like Minor Actions, if there is no test involved but the gamemaster feels the pressure is on and one should be required, they have final say in the matter.

| Major Actions               |
| --------------------------- |
| Assist (A)                  |
| Astral Projection (I)       |
| Attack (I)                  |
| Banish Spirit (I)           |
| Cast Spell (I)              |
| Cleanse (I)                 |
| Counterspell (I)            |
| Full Defense (I)            |
| Manifest (I)                |
| Observe in Detail (I)       |
| Pick Up/Put Down Object (I) |
| Ready Weapon (I)            |
| Reload Weapon (I)           |
| Rigger Jump In (I)          |
| Sprint (I)                  |
| Summon Spirit (I)           |
| Use Simple Device (I)       |
| Use Skill (I)               |

##### Assist (A)
You make the same test they are making; your Effect becomes Bonus Edge for them to use up to 7 points total from your roll.

##### Astral Projection (I)

A character capable of Astral Projection (full magician or aspected magician) may shift their consciousness to or from the astral plane as a Major Action. The process is complete the moment the action is declared and therefore places them on the astral plane immediately, including for the remainder of the current combat round.

##### Attack (I)

A character may perform one of a variety of forms of attack with this Major Action. See the below for more details.

##### Banish Spirit (I)

Any character may attempt a Banishing on a spirit as a Major Action

##### Cast Spell (I)

A character may cast a spell as a Major Action. For details on how, see Spells

##### Cleanse (I)

Awakened characters use this action to erase traces of their magic activity

##### Counterspell (A)

Perform Counterspell (see Magic)

##### Full Defense (A)

A character can add their Willpower to all Defense tests until their next turn. It persists through attacks until their next turn.

##### Manifest (I)

Characters who are astrally projecting use this action to appear as a ghostly form

##### Observe in Detail (I)

A character may make a detailed observation by taking a Major Action. This action allows a Perception test or Assensing test. This action is intended for determining details that may be obscured due to the pace and rigors of combat. It is assumed that everyone engaged in a combat is aware of the presence of everyone else, barring the use of Stealth or obscuring magic, but not necessarily details of their gear or equipment, and in some particularly hectic or rushed circumstances, the identity of individuals. In the midst of a hectic gunfight/ brawl in the dark, the winner of the brawl, who is now sprinting toward your character, may not be identifiable without an Observe in Detail action. (Deprecated)

##### Pick Up/Put Down Object (I)

A character may pick up an object within reach or put down one that they were holding as a Major Action. This action means care is taken to put the object down or pick it up. If the picked-up object is a weapon, this counts as readying the weapon.

##### Ready Weapon (I)

A character may ready a weapon by using this action. This includes drawing and readying a firearm; pulling a melee weapon from a sheath or pocket; taking out and readying a grenade or throwing knife; or any other kind of weapon preparation. Almost all weapons require this action before they are ready for use, though many times it occurs before combat even starts. Small weapons such as throwing knives and shuriken can be readied in bunches, with a total number equal to the character’s Agility attribute pulled into the character’s off-hand with a single Ready Weapon action.

##### Reload Weapon (I)

Weapons without a smartlink, or weapons where the smartlink is currently disengaged, require a Major Action to reload. Reloading a weapon refills the weapon to its maximum capacity as long as the character has sufficient ammunition to do so.

##### Rigger Jump In (I)

A character with a vehicle control rig (VCR) and rigger-adapted vehicle or drone or a rigger command console (RCC) may jump in to control the vehicle or operate the RCC with a Major Action.

##### Sprint (I)

A character may move at a Sprint with this Major Action. Movement starts at 15 yards and is increased by 1 yard per effect on an `Athletics + Agility Test (1)`. Only one Sprint Action is allowed per player turn, and it cannot be performed in the same turn as a Move action or Avoid Incoming action.

##### Summon Spirit (I)

A character capable of summoning may use a Major Action to summon a spirit to assist them. A spirit that is already summoned is controlled using the Command Spirit Minor Action.

##### Use Simple Device (I)

A character can use any simple device with a Major Action. Simple devices are those that are activated with a simple movement like a thumb trigger, pressing a single key, or tapping a single icon. It takes longer to interact with more complex devices, with required time being up to the gamemaster or listed with the description of specific gear. Remember, a device connected via a DNI-enabled system uses the Minor Action.

##### Use Skill (I)

A character may use an appropriate skill by using a Major Action



### Combat Round

A combat round is approximately 3 seconds long in the game world. During a single combat round, each participant gets an allotment of Actions to use on or around their player turn. The basic Action allotment for each character is 1 Minor Action and 1 Major Action per combat round. Players get 1 additional Minor Action for every Initiative Die they have.

Actions can be traded between Minor and Major, but there are restrictions. A Major Action can be used to perform a Minor Action, simple as that. A character can also trade 4 Minor Actions to perform 1 Major Action.

Characters may never start a player turn with more than 5 Minor Actions. If they would have earned more through any circumstances, that number is reduced to 5.

#### Attacks

Ranged Attack Rolls are rolled as: `3d6 + Firearms + Agility + Misc` vs. Targets Defense.

>Oda is firing a pistol using Firearms 5 + Agility 7 + 1 for a wireless active smartlink (he’s not worried about a hacker in this gang), for a modifier of 13. The Eye-Fiver defends with Reaction 4 + Intuition 3, a defense of 17.
>
> Oda gets 2 Bonus Edge and uses them for both to get 1 more Effect. Oda rolls and gets a 24 more than enough to hit the Eye-Fiver. Comparing the Effect Dice for Oda who has a 6 on his Effect Dice and the Eye-Fiver has a 2 on his Effect Dice. Making the Net Effect 4, Oda adds his +1 Effect from his Bonus Edge spend to have 5 Net Effect.



### Damage

Involved as they are in an illegal and often hazardous line of work, runners get hurt and get hurt often. What kind of damage, how bad an injury is, and how much it affects the character vary greatly depending on the situation.

Damage is calculated based on the weapon, spell, effect in Physical or Stun. You deduct that from your Health. 

> Continuing from Above
> We calculate the incoming damage using the base Damage Value of the Ares Predator VI (3P) and add the net effect (5) to get a modified Damage Value of 8. The Eye-Fiver leader has a Toughness of 1 to soak the Damage, reducing the incoming damage to 7 of Physical Damage. As an NPC the Eye-Fiver only has 10 Health so he has 3 left. 

#### Types of Injury

Damage in Sixfinity is defined as Physical or Stun. Each type of damage is tracked on a separate Condition Monitor.

##### Physical Damage

Physical damage, the most dangerous type, is the kind done by guns, explosions, most melee weapons, and many magic spells. Weapons that inflict Physical damage have the letter “P” following their Damage Value. Physical damage takes a longer time to heal.

##### Stun Damage

Stun damage—bruising, muscle fatigue, and the like— is the kind done by fists, kicks, blunt weapons, stun rounds, shock weapons, concussion grenades, and some magic spells. If something does Stun damage, the letter “S” follows the Damage Value. Stun damage takes a shorter time to heal.

### Healing

We’ve explained to you how to put the hurt on, so now let’s talk about getting the hurt off. Healing in Shadowrun is a mix of in-the-field first aid, miraculous magic, futuristic tech, and heroic speeds of natural recovery. Getting back in the fight is a lot more fun than lying in a hospital bed for weeks or months.

The first thing to cover is the order of operations for healing. Do you need to apply first aid before magic or after? Can you magically heal someone who’s already been treated by a medkit? The answer is simple: The order doesn’t matter, except that Overflow damage heals first. Every character gets multiple chances to get patched up before they’re stuck carrying around their injuries for days. The key here is how soon each needs to be applied. Details are under each description below.

#### First Aid
- Biotech + Logic (5 - Essence)

As implied by the name, this is probably the first aid you should apply because it has the narrowest window. After the end of a combat encounter in which a character was injured, they have 1 minute (20 combat rounds if another fight kicks off) to receive First Aid. To apply First Aid, a character needs the right tools for the job, in this case a first aid kit. Any test made without a kit suffers a -2 modifier, and no Edge can be spent on the test.

Make a `Biotech + Logic test against a threshold equal to 5 – target’s Essence`. If the target is one-hundred-percent natural, the healer actually gets an automatic +1 Effect added to what they roll. This represents the difficulty of repairing someone who has metal parts as well as those with organs not normally found in average people. Effect is used to heal 4 points of Stun Damage (**not including drain**) per effect or 4 points of Physical Damage or 2 points of Overflow per effect. Drain cannot be healed with First Aid. A character can receive First Aid only once for any single set of injuries.

#### Medkit
- Biotech + Logic (5 - Essence)

Medkits are more detailed. The patient must be connected to medkit monitors and diagnosed, after which they receive injections and IVs. After the end of a combat encounter in which a character is injured, they have one hour to be connected to a medkit or get medical attention from a trained professional with a medkit. If they wait beyond this period, a medkit will not help them. It takes one minute to hook up the patient, get the medkit to spit out a diagnosis, and begin treatment. The healing process takes one minute per 4 points healed (so, if the process is interrupted, you know how much they were patched up). Each time a medkit is used, it consumes one batch of supplies. Treatment cannot be attempted if no medkit supplies remain.

Make a `Biotech/Medkit Rating + Logic test against a threshold of 5 – target’s Essence`. If the target is one-hundred-percent natural, the healer gets an automatic +1 Effect added to their roll. Like First Aid, this fixes biological material, not machinery. Effect is used to heal 4 points of Stun, Physical, or Overflow Damage per Effect, but not damage from drain.

There is a limit to receiving a medkit treatment. A character can only benefit from a medkit once for any single set of injuries.

#### Magic
- Sorcery + Magic (using Healing or similar spell)

The wonders of magic are many and great. Healing spells are some of the most commonly studied magics for those working on the streets. Some use their skills to earn a little extra cash patching up gangers; others serve on a runner team, keeping their partners fighting when the bullets start finding their targets. Those with hearts of gold work as regular street healers to give the denizens of the barrens a chance at a healthy life.

The good news about magical healing is it works at the speed of a spell—once the spell is cast, the effect takes hold.

Healing magic can mend both Physical and Stun injuries, but not those caused by Drain. The leftover taint of wearisome mana prevents the healing magics from connecting to that damaged tissue to heal it. As with medkits, net effect can be used to heal 4 points of Stun, Physical, or Overflow Damage per Effect. For more information on casting healing spells, see Magic.

A character can be healed by Magic only once for any single set of injuries.

#### Natural Recovery/Medical Assistance (Varies by damage type)

After all other options have been used, if injury remains, it’s all about rest and possibly some help from a trained medical professional (or just your team medic). Rest is simply defined as not engaging in any strenuous physical or mental activity—essentially, anything that involves a dice roll would break your rest. Medical attention offers a bonus to the recovery roll. If any person trained in Biotech is watching over the character for at least half of their rest period, the wounded individual gains a +2 Effect to the healing tests defined below.

To heal Physical Damage, roll `Body + Body (1)` once per day. Each Effect heals 4 points of Physical Damage after that day of rest.

To heal Stun Damage, roll `Body + Willpower (1)` once per hour. Each hit heals 4 points of Stun Damage after that hour of rest. A full 8 hour (Long Reat) rest will recover all lost Stun Health.

#### Overflow & Dying

Sometimes a hit brings you closer to death than you ever really want to be, and you’ve got some Damage Overflow to recover. These points are healed just like Physical Damage and need to be healed before the character can return to the land of the conscious. Note that if a character receives (Body x 2) points of Overflow damage, they are dead and gone, beyond the reach of any kind of healing.

### Status List
The different statuses used in Shadowrun, Sixth World are described below.


#### Blinded I, II, III

Whether it’s flashing lights, some specialized chemical, or the pure force of magic, there are plenty of ways to make it impossible for shadowrunners to see. For the first two levels of this status, characters take a –3 penalty per level to all tests involving visibility. At the third level, characters automatically fail any tests involving visibility.

#### Burning #

The Burning status is the result of being hit with a flame-based attack. Once the initial blow has done its damage, you have to deal with the continuing heat and flames, and the parts of yourself that may be on fire. **Toughness has no effect on this damage.**

The status should be noted with a number that indicates the amount of Physical damage the character must resist each round while the status exists. There are multiple ways to remove this status. You can spend a Major Action and roll an `Agility + Reaction (2) test`; success means the fire is out and the status is removed. You can also jump into water to remove the status without a roll.

If you gain the Wet and/or Chilled statuses, the Burning status is canceled. Similarly, gaining the Burning status cancels the Wet or Chilled status.

#### Charmed
- A charmed creature can’t attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.
- The charmer has +3 on any test to interact socially with the creature.

#### Chilled

When you are truly, damagingly cold, it seeps into your bones and won’t let go, and you can’t move as smoothly and nimbly as you would like. When you are Chilled, you get –4 to your Initiative Score and –1 to all tests. This status cancels and is canceled by the Burning status.

#### Confused #

Colors, patterns, and weird ideas swirl around your head, keeping you from being able to focus, which makes your actions uncoordinated and awkward. The number after the status acts as a penalty on any test you take.

#### Corrosive #

Acids, bases, and other caustics eat into your flesh and don’t stop. The ongoing damage from these chemicals is noted with the Corrosive status, which comes with a number after it to denote how much damage the ongoing effect inflicts. **Toughness has no effect on this damage.**

This status can be removed with certain gear (like baking soda for acids!) and equipment. The Wet status does not necessarily remove it, as some chemicals continue burning the skin even after contact with water. The gamemaster can determine when enough water has been applied to remove the chemical in question.

#### Cover I, II, III, IV

Whether you hide behind a wall, a dumpster, or a body, Cover is protection from hostile fire. It comes at four levels, indicating how much of a character’s body is protected (one-quarter, onehalf, three quarters, or all). A character in Cover gets a +2 bonus per Cover level to their Defense Rating. Attacking from Cover requires an extra Minor Action in order to get clear enough to take a shot, imposes a –2 penalty to your attack at Cover IV, and you cannot gain Bonus Edge while attacking from Cover (you can gain it from defending).

#### Dazed

One too many thumps to the head, or maybe the solar plexus, leaves the character woozy and unable to act with their normal alacrity. The character reduces their Initiative Score by –4, and they cannot gain or spend Edge (but they can burn Edge) as long as they have this Status.

#### Deafened I, II, III

Whether you heard a sudden, hugely loud clap, or someone stuffed your ears full of cotton-like mana, sound waves are not getting through so that your brain can tell you what they mean. For the first two levels of this status, characters take a –3 penalty per level to all tests involving hearing. At the third level, characters automatically fail any tests involving hearing.

#### Fatigued I, II, III

At its top level, this status is that dreamlike weariness, where your legs are lead and just will. Not. Move. Characters with this status take a –2 penalty per level to all tests. Characters move at 5 yards per turn instead of 10 for walking, and 10 instead of 15 for sprinting.

#### Frightened

Something has hit your lizard brain, and rational thought flees. All you have left is fear. Characters take a –4 penalty to any tests directed to or defending against the source of the effect. They also cannot move toward the source of their fear. 

#### Hazed

Something has messed up your connection to the astral world, leaving that realm out of your reach. Or worse, if you were already astral, you’re stuck there. A character with this status is unable to move between the astral plane and the physical world. They cannot astrally project or manifest. They may still perceive astrally.

#### Hobbled

Any movement on foot, whether by the Move, Sprint, or Avoid Incoming action, is halved (round up). Said another way it cost twice movement to move.

#### Immobilized

Just what it sounds like! Characters with this status cannot move, though they can take any actions that will function with their feet stuck to the ground. Their Attack Rating is reduced by 3, and they take a –3 penalty on all attacks. They cannot use Reaction on their Defense tests.

#### Incapacitated
- An incapacitated creature can’t take actions or reactions.

#### Invisible #

The go-to status for sneak thieves. Characters are less visible to living and sentient beings. The number after the status indicates the threshold step people must hit on a Perception test to notice the character with this status. Cameras and other inorganic methods of visibility detection can see someone with this status as normal.

#### Invisible (Improved) #

The same as Invisibility, but it also affects camera and other technological ways of seeing.

#### Nauseated

Your stomach heaves, your head spins, and you have trouble thinking about anything other than not throwing up. Characters must pass a `Body + Willpower (2)` test at the start of a combat round. If they fail, they cannot take an action that round. If they succeed, they can act, but they lose a Minor Action.

#### Panicked

The drek has hit the fan, and it has splattered everywhere, and you have lost the ability to act in any sort of a coherent fashion. Characters with this status cannot act except to avoid the condition that is causing the Panicked effect.

#### Petrified

There is a good reason why you don’t want to be in the wrong end of a basilisk stare, and this is it. The character is essentially turned into solid material. They cannot take any actions, and they get a +10 Armor Rating. This cancels any other damaging statuses the character may have been experiencing.

#### Poisoned #

Something wrong has gotten into the character’s body, and it’s going to mess them up until it works its way through. This status has a damage code after it, with a number and an indication for either Physical or Stun damage. At the end of each combat round when this status exists, the character must take the damage, Toughness does not apply. The damage decreases by 1 each round. Antidotes, both physical and magical, can remove this status.

#### Prone

One of the classics—you drop to the ground to get a stable shot and make yourself tougher to shoot. The character’s movement rate is reduced to two yards, and they cannot Sprint. They get a +3 bonus on Defense Tests against ranged attacks from Medium range or farther, but –3 on attacks from Close or Near ranges due to their immobility. They also get a –4 penalty to melee attacks or bow attacks. They increase the Attack Rating of any firearm or projectile weapon (besides bows) by 2.

#### Silent #

Your ability to make noise is greatly hindered. The number after the status indicates the threshold step people must hit on a Perception test to hear the character with this status. Microphones and other inorganic methods of audio detection can pick up sounds of someone with this status as normal.

#### Silent (Improved) #
The same as Silent, except microphones and other forms of technology are also affected.

#### Stilled

There’s bad news and good news! The bad news is you can’t move. Your feet are absolutely stuck in place. You get a –10 penalty on your Defense Rating against incoming attacks (minimum 0), and you can’t take any actions beyond Perception and mental communication, should you be able to do that. You also cannot roll tests. The good news is, being Stilled halts any ongoing damage or other effects on the character. New damage may be inflicted, but any ongoing effects from it will also be canceled by this status.

#### Stunned
- A stunned creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can’t move, and can speak only falteringly.
- The creature automatically fails reactions
- Defense Score is at a -3 penalty.

#### Unconcious
- An Unconscious character is Incapacitated, can’t move or speak, and is unaware of their surroundings.
- The character drops whatever they’re holding and falls Prone.
- Any attack that hits the character is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet.

#### Wet

Whether it’s a pouring rain, a sudden wave, or the efforts of a rampaging water spirit, you are soaked from head to toe. You take double damagefrom cold and electricity damage. Cancels the Burning status, is canceled by the Burning status, and may affect the Corrosive status.

#### Zapped

A jolt of electrical power has hit you, leaving you fried and scattered. Your muscles aren’t working quite right, either. The character suffers a –2 to their Initiative Score, the inability to take the Sprint Action, and a penalty of –1 on all actions.

### Damage Types

Certain weapons and attacks deliver damage besides simple kinetic energy transfer. These forms of attacks, such as flamethrowers, fireballs, lightning bolts, tasers, and toxic waves to name a few, usually have a secondary and/or extended Status effect beyond the initial attack and damage result.

#### Electricity

Getting zapped not only hurts, but it also seizes muscles and leaves a victim shaky from muscle tremors. If a character shakes off the damage, they’re all good, but if they suffer even a single box, the character gets the Zapped status for 2 combat rounds.

#### Chemical (acids, bases, caustics, etc.) 

Attacks that involve corrosive chemicals—acids, bases, caustics, toxins, etc.—tend to stick around and cause damage on subsequent rounds. Chemical attacks add the Corrosive status. Additionally, if the modified Damage Value of an attack exceeds the Armor of the target, the Defense boost from that piece of armor is permanently decreased by one after the attack is resolved.

#### Cold

No one likes being cold. The shakes, chattering teeth, hypothermia, and tissue damage are just a few reasons your life will be harder after you get hit by a cold-based attack. Taking damage from an attack with a Cold damage type inflicts the Chilled status for 3 combat rounds. Lastly, if the modified Damage Value of an attack exceeds the Armor of the target, the Defense boost from that piece of armor is permanently decreased by one after the attack is resolved.

#### Fire

Once you’re hit by an attack that involves fire, the fire ignites flammable objects, including you. This effect means the fire burns for several rounds after the first. Taking damage from an attack with a Fire damage type inflicts the Burning status.

Gamemaster note: The damage and duration are subject to your discretion if the target has some mitigating circumstance. If they’re covered in oil or wearing a lot of loose-fitting cloth, it may last longer, cause more damage, or require a higher threshold to extinguish.



## Chapter 9: Magic

The world is made up of two parts.

The Sleeping World & The Awakened World.

The Sleeping World is unaware of magic. This Chapter focuses on the Awakened World.

The Awakened world is permeated by mana, the energy of magic. Mana is invisible and intangible. It cannot be detected, measured, or influenced by machines, only by living beings. Mana is sensitive. to emotion and responds to the will of the Awakened. It allows magicians to cast spells. Mana also makes the powers of adepts and various Awakened creatures possible.

**Magic Attribute**

Awakened creatures and magical effects have their magical potency measured by either the Magic or Force attributes. Magic is the attribute possessed by Awakened creatures—including humanoids while Force is the principle attribute for magic items and entities of pure mana—spirits and spells.

Magic is a Special attribute that measures the character’s magical power. Like other attributes, Magic has a starting value of 1. The Magic attribute may be increased in the same way as other attributes, to a maximum of 6. Magical study and insight can raise a magician’s Magic attribute beyond the normal maximum though a process called initiation.

If a character’s Magic is ever reduced to 0, she can no longer perform any kind of magic. The magician has “burned out,” losing all magical ability and becoming a mundane forever. She retains all magical skills and knowledge, but lacks the ability to use them. Active skills become Knowledge skills. 

Spells, spirits, and magic items have an attribute known as Force. This measures the magical power of the object, spell, or being. Force is measured on the same scale as humanoid attributes (natural 1 to 6). For spells and items, this is often their only attribute.

**The Three Realms**

Magicians are aware of three “realms” of existence. The first is the physical realm, our natural physical world, and all of its corresponding physical laws. 

On one “side” of us, we have the astral realm. The astral realm occupies the same “space” as the physical plane, but has different “physical” (“astral?”) laws. It is always there, right next door, just a step sideways. It thrives on life, and so emotion, thought, and spirit are emphasized on the astral. Without life, there is no astral space; and so without a thriving gaiasphere to support it, the astral plane does not extend into space. Using what is often called their "third eye" Magicians can see the Astral realm.

On the other side (and curving around, as it were, to meet the astral plane on its far edge) we have the metaplanar realm. The metaplanes are not one place but many, and their true nature and purpose are beyond the ken of ordinary magicians. (See The Planes)

Each realm is separated by a barrier, a wall of sorts that stops us from randomly wandering from one realm into another. Magicians have learned to extend their senses onto the astral realm, to astrally perceive what goes on there. Full magicians can actually leave their physical bodies and project their spirits onto the astral plane. Psychic travel to the metaplanes is also possible, but is a much more complicated affair.

**Magical Lodges**

In order to progress in her studies, a magician must have a collection of symbols, writings,
tools, and other material that allows her to record her progress, gives her room to expand her
knowledge, and assists her in her magical endeavors. Such a collection of items and information is known as a magical lodge. Magicians of the same tradition can share a magical lodge.

A magical lodge is required to improve Magic-linked skills, learn new spells, and perform Ritual Spellcasting. A lodge has a Force rating that is used to measure its power. The Force of a lodge must be at least equal to the skill rating being learned or the force of a spell being cast.

A lodge has a Resource cost of 2 per Force point, and the lodge’s rating can be improved later.

For example if you want to purchase a Force 1 Lodge you need to make a {Threshold} 12 Resource test. A Force 3 Lodge would be a {Threshold} 16. 

The money is spent to buy the supplies used to build the lodge. Once the supplies are gathered, the magician must complete an activation ritual that will “awaken” the lodge and construct its astral presence. The actual process requires 1 day per point of Force desired. An activated lodge acts as an astral barrier. Any magicians involved in the activation of the lodge are unaffected by this barrier, and can allow other astral forms to pass through it at will. A lodge contains the astral signatures of the magicians who activated it (see Astral Signatures), and is magically linked to them. This link can be tracked using astral projection (see Astral Tracking).

To increase the rating of an existing lodge, additional materials must be acquired. An activation ritual must also be performed, taking a number of days equal to the difference between the current Force and the desired Force. The cost of searching and gathering can be simplified to a cost of Resource 2 per Force point as above. Improving a Force 4 lodge to Force 6, for example, would cost Resource {Threshold} 22 (6 * 2 + 10) and take two days of ritual.

### Spellcasting

When a magician casts a spell, the player first chooses the Force of the spell and then rolls her `3D6 + Spellcasting + Magic VS {Threshold}`. Other sources of power (foci, spirit spellcasting aid) and Visibility modifiers may affect the final outcome. The success of a spell is measured by the {Threshold} on the test.

Many times the {Threshold} is the targets Defense for targeted spells. 

Steps for Spellcasting:

- Step 1: Choose a Spell. She can cast any spell she knows. Remember you can only have one Concentration Spell active at a time.
- Step 2: Choose the Force. The maximum Force a spell can be cast at equals the spellcaster’s Magic rating x 2. 
- Step 3: Choose the targets. Area spells you choose a location for the center, targeted spells you choose a target withing Line of Sight.
- Step 4: Make the Spellcasting Test. `3D6 + Spellcasting + Magic` VS {Threshold}. (Unless opposed the {Threshold} is 10 + Force)
- Step 5: Determine the effect. Some spells only require a success and the Effect determines how effective the spell is. Opposed test against living targets often trigger Willpower or other Reactions. Spells cast on astral objects like mana barriers or active foci are resisted with Force. **The Effect CANNOT exceed the Spells Force**
- Step 6: Fatigue Test. `3D6 + Willpower VS. 9 + Spells Force` if you succeed you cast it with minimal issues, if you fail you suffer effects (see Spell Fatigue below)
- Step 7: Concentration. Many spells can be sustained for as long as the magician is willing to concentrate on the spell, as noted in the spell’s Duration. If you take damage while maintaining concentration you must succeed on a `3D6 + Willpower Vs 10 or Half Damage taken rounded down up to 25 whichever is higher`

### Counterspelling

**This is considered a Reaction.**

Counterspelling is used to interrupt other spells, either as they are being cast or while they are sustained. To interrupt a spell as it is being cast a Counterspelling roll `3D6 + Counterspelling + Magic` is rolled versus the opposing Spellcasting roll `3D6 + Spellcasting + Magic`, if the Counterspell is higher the spell is canceled. Force does not come into play here because the Spell has not been completed yet.

For example Paige is fighting another Mage in a bar. The other Mage is preparing to cast Fireball. Paige rolls `3D6 + Counterspelling + Magic` she has a Counterspelling of 4 and a Magic of 5, the rolls a 12 and ends up with a 21. The enemy Mage has a Magic of 4 and a Spellcasting of 4, rolls a 12 on 3D6. Since Paige beat the enemy Mage's roll the spell is Countered and no Fireball is cast. 

When dispelling it is very similar, a Counterspelling + Magic Opposed Test is made against the target spell’s Force + caster’s Magic, if the roll is greater than the {Threshold} of the spell it is dispelled.

For Example if Paige is trying to dispel a sealed door. She rolls `3D6 + Counterspelling + Magic vs {Threshold} from the Gamemaster`. The GM knows that the caster had a Force of 6 for the spell and their magic was 6 so `{Threshold} = 10 + 6 + 6` the {Threshold} is 22.


### Force

A spell’s only attribute is its Force—the measure of the spell’s raw power. A spell’s Force helps determine its effectiveness and its Fatigue. Thee Force of a spell is chosen by the caster during spellcasting, typically at a value up to the Magic attribute of the magician who cast it. The maximum Force that a spell can be cast at is equal to twice the character’s Magic.

For simplicity, you may wish to decide that spells are always cast at a Force equal to the character’s Magic attribute unless otherwise noted. This certainly makes tracking Fatigue rolls easier.

A spell’s Force limits the Effect that can be achieved on the Spellcasting Test. So if you cast a Force 3 spell and get 5 Effect, only 3 of those count. In other words, Force has a limiting effect on spells—the more oomph you put into the spell, the better you can succeed with it. 

### Spell Fatigue 

When using a power, the player rolls a fatigue test for the character. This is a test with a target number of `{Threshold} = 9 + Spells Force / 2 rounded down`. Often times spells have a Fatigue Value or FV listed this represents the `Spell Force / 2 Rounded down` math already done.

Fatigue tests are Willpower Reactions. `3D6 + Willpower VS. 9 + Fatigue Value`

If the test succeeds, using the power costs the character only negligible effort. If the fatigue test fails, the character takes the Fatigue Value in Stun Damage (see Stun Damage) if they suffer enough Stun damage to reduce them to zero Physical Health they are Stunned for 1 Minute. After that they are 1 point away from Stunned and Exhausted.

- Exhausted: The character is nearly spent. An exhausted character has a –3 penalty to all tests, moves at half their normal speed, and cannot Run or Charge. 

Additionally, if the character loses more than half their Physical Health while exhausted, they become unconscious for 1d6 hours, or until restored to greater than half their maximum Physical Health. After 6 hours unconscious, they regain 10 + Body in Physical Health and regain consciousness.


Characters can recover from fatigue by resting, as follows:
- Taking a 5-minute breather is enough to recover BOD + STR in Stun Damage. You gain this benefit in addition to the normal amount of Physical Health you recover from a breather.
- Resting for at least 4 hours, with only light activity (talking, reading, and the like, but not standing or riding) allows you to recover from all Stun Damage, so long as you also eat and drink something during that time.
- Sleeping for at least 6 hours allows you to recover from being exhausted, as well as all Stun Damage in addition to the Physical Health benefits of such rest.

**Optional Rule**

Simple Fatigue.

Gamemasters and players should keep the following system in mind for making spell Fatigue calculation easier. Rather than choosing the Force and calculating the Fatigue each time a spell is cast, simply assume that spells are always cast at a Force equal to the character’s Magic attribute. In this case, the Fatigue for each spell can be pre-calculated and written on the character sheet, so you do not have to bother calculating it during actual gameplay.

If a character decides at some point to cast a spell at a different Force value, simply modify the Fatigue by +1 or –1 for every 2 points the player increases or decreases the Force, respectively.

For example, a player who has a mage with Magic 5 can assume that she always casts her Acid Stream spell at Force 5, and so she writes the Fatigue down as FV 5 (based on Acid Stream’s Fatigue formula for Force 5). If she decides to cast the spell at Force 3 instead, the Fatigue is modified to FV 4 (base FV 5 minus 1 per 2 points of Force reduction). If she decides to cast it at Force 7, her FV would be 6 (+1 per 2 points)—and the Fatigue if failed would be Physical Damage in lieu of Fatigue (see overcasting below) as the Force exceeds her Magic.

### Overcasting

If a caster wants the Spells Force to exceed their Magic Rating (maximum force is Magic x 2) they will suffer more dangerous outcomes than simple fatigue. If they fail the Fatituge test they will take the Fatigue Value as Damage instead of suffering Exhaustion levels as above. 

For example is Paige has a Magic of 5 and decides to cast Acid Stream at Force 7 the Fatigue Value (based on the spells formula) would be 6. Since The Force 7 exceeds Paige's Magic if she fails her Fatigue check (`3D6 + Willpower VS. {Threshold} 15`) Paige will take 6 points of Physical damage instead of suffering exhaustion. 

While dangerous it represents a magician putting their life into a spell. In some settings, some spells **require** it to be physical.

### Learning New Spells

Before a magician can cast a spell, she must learn it. A magician can learn a spell from either a spell formula or from another magician, but the source has to be of a compatible tradition (gamemaster’s discretion). A magician must have a magical lodge in order to experiment with and master what she has learned, adapting it to her own personal style and understanding of the magical world.

For most magicians (especially mages), the archaic master-apprentice model of learning a spell has largely passed by the wayside. Given the proliferation of magical information on the Net, learning from formulae has become the default method of learning new spells. Finding a spell formula is as easy as checking the Net. 

Certain spells (especially combat spells and mental manipulations) are illegal or controlled in some jurisdictions, so characters must engage caution when pursuing them, or look to black market providers/teachers. In addition, a character must expend 5 permanent Experience points per spell learned. The costs are the same whether the instruction is in person or through the Net.

Once a magician has access to a spell formula or teacher, she makes a Spellcasting + Logic (15,5, 1 day) Extended Test (see Extended Tests). Instructors can provide Help and grnt advantage on the tests. All injury modifiers apply, as do distractions for sustaining spells, poor conditions, and so on.

A character engaged in learning a spell must work on it for consecutive days. Learning a spell does not require all of the character’s
attention during those days, but the magician must be able to devote 8 hours each day solely to learning the spell until she has it mastered.
Should a day be missed before the test is completed, the character automatically fails the test and does not learn the spell. No Experience is expended in this case, but any money and time spent on instruction is lost. 

### Traditions

#### Hermetic Tradition

Concept: The scientific study of magic as a complex pattern of elemental forces that can be controlled with the right formulae and rituals.

- Combat: Fire Magic
- Detection: Air Magic
- Physical Health: Man
- Illusion: Water Magic
- Maniuplation: Earth Magic

A hermetic magician’s ability to perform magic comes from the study of a complex set of theories that describe mana, the dimensions of astral space, and how they interact with the physical world. The science of thaumaturgy, as this discipline is called, draws those who rely on logic and reason as their means of evaluating the world. As with any vibrant field, while the basics are largely agreed upon, the theories as to how it all works and what magic can do are as varied as the mages themselves. By seeking understanding, mages can perform magic through ritual and focused power of will.

Mages are scholars who study and practice magic using tried and established formulas and procedures. Mages continually research the theories and laws of magic, seeking a deeper understanding of the structure of the universe. As their knowledge increases, so does their power.

In Veilstriders Hermetic Mages attend school at Arkham in Mass. 

Examples: Harry Dresden

#### Sorcerous Tradition

Concept: The channeling of internal magical power through an object to manifest power

- Combat: Air Magic
- Detection: Earth Magic
- Physical Health: Water Magic
- Illusion: Man
- Maniuplation: Fire Magic

This tradition is taught to people who are born with magical latent ability. Taught to channel it through an object like a wand.

Examples: Harry Potter

#### Shamanic Tradition

- Combat: Beasts
- Detection: Water
- Physical Health: Earth
- Illusion: Air
- Manipulation: Man

To a shaman, the world is filled with living spirits, powers the shaman calls on for magical aid. Shamanic magicians summon spirits that are tied to nature: air, earth, water, beasts, and man. To a shaman, these are the spirits of the natural world. They are spirits of skies and storms, of mountains and valleys, of lakes and rivers, of birds and rats, and of the mass of humanity, for even man is a part of nature. Communion and trafficking with such spirits is a venerable and honored tradition among shamans.

Examples: Native American Magic.

### The Astral World

While the physical realm is the world characters know and walk in every day, another realm exists alongside it, invisible and unnoticed by most of the people on the planet. that place is called the astral plane, a sort of photo-negative of the physical world where only living things—things infused with mana—are real.

Mana, the essence of magic, flows from the metaplanes into our physical world and through it to the astral plane, where it pools and infuses the astral plane with its nature.

The astral plane is fueled by the life force that exists in and on our planet, and the general aura of that force illuminates the astral world at all times with an ambient glow. Things that exist only on the physical plane can be seen and heard from the astral, albeit with blurred features and indistinct sound—emotional content registers far more strongly than exact details. 

#### Astral Willpower

Many Awakened characters can perceive the astral plane from the physical world. This ability is called astral perception sometimes called "Third Eye". It is the primary sense used in the astral plane; it shows auras, allowing magicians to examine living creatures in the physical world as well as creatures who live on the astral plane. Astral Willpower is available to characters who take the Magician quality during character generation.

It takes a Minor Action to shift one’s perception from the astral to the physical, and another to shift it back again (it is not possible to see both at the same time, though almost everything in physical space is reflected on the astral, albeit without detail). A character using astral perception is considered dual-natured, active on both the physical and astral planes simultaneously.

While astral perception allows an Awakened character to sense the astral plane, actually interpreting what is sensed takes practice. Interpreting auras to gain information about the person or thing to whom they belong is called Assensing. A magician who wishes to learn more about an aura must make an Assensing test `Magic + Perception Rating` test against the {Threshold} as outlined on the Assensing Table (below). Without attempting to read an aura, a magician can still get an impression of what type of aura it is (spell, spirit, living creature, etc.).

Like physical perception, a character using astral perception should not need to make a test to see things that are immediately obvious (and since astral forms are bright and vibrant, this means that most astral forms are easily noticed). An actual test should only be called for when an astral being is specifically trying to hide, or when a character is trying to astrally observe in detail; in both these situations, an Assensing Test is made.

By assensing something’s aura, a magician can gain information. The auras of living beings show their general health, emotions, and magical nature (if any). Enchanted objects show their magical nature. Non-magical and non-living objects have only gray, lackluster shadows rather than auras, but pick up impressions from being in contact with living auras. Assensing can read any impressions left behind on an object.

Spells cast upon an individual show up as a separate aura surrounding that person for the duration of the spell. Once a spell has been rendered permanent, the aura is no longer present. It is occasionally possible to see the traces that magic spells leave behind in a target’s aura; see Astral Signatures for more information.

Whenever you have to perform a physical, non-magical task (shooting a gun, driving a car, and so forth) while astrally perceiving, you suffer Disadvantage on the roll. While astrally perceiving, a magician can cast mana spells at astral opponents. Other astral forms can engage an astrally perceiving magician in astral combat or cast mana spells at him as well.

Astral perception is a psychic sense that is not linked to the character’s physical sight. A blind magician can still magically perceive the astral plane and the creatures and auras within. Likewise, deaf magicians can “hear” in astral space.

| 30          | An accurate diagnosis of any disease or toxins which afflict the subject. Who their first born child is, what they had for breakfast              |


#### Astral Signatures

Magical skills and abilities produce an astral signature on anything affected by them, which is detectable using assensing. An astral signature is the magical “fingerprint” of the Awakened creature who created it. A signature lasts for a number of hours equal to a magical effects Force after the effect ends. Foci and other magical items (like magical lodges) always contain the astral signature of their owner (or owners). A character can attempt to read an astral signature with an Assensing Test. A {Threshold} 20+ is required to detect the signature. Once seen, a signature can be recognized if the character sees it again (perhaps requiring a memory test). With a {Threshold} 25, she also gets an impression of what magical effect created the signature (the magical skill used and the general class of spell or spirit).

Magical forensic investigators use astral signatures to gather information about criminal magicians, so characters should be careful about leaving astral signatures where they are likely to be seen by anyone who knows them.

A magician using astral perception may take a number of Complex Actions equal to the Force of an astral signature to erase it completely.

### Initiation

As Awakened characters grow in power, they often find that their initial explorations into magic and the astral plane can only take them so far in understanding and increasing their abilities. In order to increase their powers, magicians will often choose to undergo initiation in the mysteries of magic, the astral world, and the metaplanes in hope of increasing their connection with the Awakened world.

Initiation is measured in grades, beginning with Grade 1 and increasing. At the end of a character’s first initiation, she is a Grade 1 initiate. When she completes her second initiation, she is a Grade 2 initiate, and so on. The numerical system is for tracking initiation levels in game terms: each tradition refers to grades of initiation in their own way. 

The cost to initiate is equal to 10 + (Grade x 3) in Experience points. Characters who wish to initiate must pay that cost in order to achieve their new grade.
 
A character’s initiate grade cannot exceed her Magic attribute. If a character’s Magic is reduced below her initiate grade, she loses that level of initiation and the metamagic she gained with it.

#### Initiate Powers

**Increased Magic**

An initiate’s natural maximum for the Magic attribute is 6 + her grade of initiation. She will still have to pay normally to increase her Magic attribute. 

**Metaplanar Access**

Upon a character’s first initiation, a character usually gains access to a special Demiplane for their Initiation. 

**More Powers**

Some settings have more powers for Initiation.

### Spells

How to read a spell.

- Category: This describes the manner in which a spell affect its target, as well as what spirits will be associated with that type of spell. The categories are: Combat, Detection, Physical Health, Illusion, and Manipulation.
- Type: Spell Type is either mana (M) or physical (P). Mana spells affect their targets through the mana that permeates the astral and physical planes affecting the target in a magical and spiritual manner that is only effectively resisted by the Willpower of a living or magical being. Physical spells directly target the body; resistance relies on the target’s Stamina. Only mana spells can affect astral forms. Either type of spell may be used in the physical world, but mana spells cannot affect non-living targets.
- Range: All spells have a range at which they can be cast. For most spells, the range is line of sight (LOS). If the caster can see the target, regardless of distance, it can be affected. Some spells, particularly health spells, require the caster to touch the intended target in order for the spell to work. Other spells affect all valid targets within an area, defined as a circle with a radius equal to the spell’s Force in yards.
- Test & {Threshold}: The type of test required if opposed, or the {Threshold} required (usually 10 + Force)
- Duration: Duration is either Instant, Concentration, or Permanent. Instant spells end the moment they are cast, and their full effects are felt immediately. Concentration spells last for as long as the magician concentrates on them. Permanent spells must be Concentrationated for a short time, after which their effects become “natural” and no longer require magic or concentration to maintain. The time required to make a spell’s effects permanent is equal to twice the Fatgiue Value in Combat Turns.
- Fatigue Value: This describes the Fatigue Value required for the Fatigue Test. Fatigue is based on the spell’s Force; the more powerful the spell, the more exhausting it is to cast. Fatigue is variable, based on the spell’s Force ÷ 2, rounded down, and modified by Fatigue modifiers appropriate to each spell. Failed Fatigue Tests cause Stun Damage and possibly Exhaustion (see Spell Fatigue above), unless the spell is overcast (cast at a Force higher than the magician’s Magic see above), in which case it causes Fatigue Value in Physical damage. Note that no Fatigue Value can ever be less than 1.


### Combat Spells

Combat spells use mana to create damaging effects, either by direct or indirect means. Think of Direct spells as Saving Throw Spells and Indirect Spells as To Hit Spells. Though Indirect Area spells require a Quickness Reaction.

Direct Combat spells channel damaging power directly into the target’s inner being, affecting them from within, and so bypass armor (but not Toughness). 

Indirect Combat spells create an external damaging medium (often elemental in nature) that is used to attack the target. 

**Direct Combat Spells**: Handle these as an Opposed Test. The caster’s `Spellcasting + Magic` is resisted by the target’s Stamina (for physical spells) or Willpower (for mana spells), plus Counterspelling (if available). 

The caster needs beat the opposed roll by at least 1 to take effect. Direct Combat spells affect the target from the inside, so armor does not help with resistance. Toughness does help with the damage though.

> For example Paige casts Manabolt at a Security Guard. She has a 5 Spellcasting and 5 Magic. She rolls `3D6 + 5 + 5` she rolls 17 the Security Guard has a Stamina of 3 and no Counterspell so he rolls `3D6 +3` to resist the spell.

Direct Combat spells cast against nonliving objects are treated as Success Tests; the caster must achieve Effect to beat the item’s Object Resistance. Effect increase damage as normal (the object does not get a resistance test).

Direct Combat spells involve channeling mana directly into a target as destructive and damaging energies rather than generating a damaging effect. Affecting the target on this fundamental level with raw mana requires more focus and more power than producing other spell effects. After the Spellcasting is resisted the caster choses whether or not to apply any Effect to increase the damage value of the spell as normal.

**Indirect Combat Spells**: Indirect Combat spells are treated like ranged combat attacks; the caster makes a `Spellcasting + Magic` Success Test versus the target’s Defense. 

Indirect Combat spells (also commonly called AOE spells) generate a spell construct at the point of origin (the caster) which travels down the mystic link to the chosen target, whereupon it discharges and the effect defined in the spell description manifests. The spell traverses the distance between the caster and the target near instantly, but travels over the physical or astral plane to do so only to take effect when it “hits”. Hence, Indirect Spells are handled as ranged attacks and require a physically solid target or astrally active target to hit. As they travel down the link to the chosen target such effects may be impeded by physical obstacles or mana barriers. They may impact transparent obstacles (such as glass) and do not “bounce” off reflective surfaces used for line of sight. Instead the spell takes effect at the point of contact with an obstructing barrier. In the case of mana barriers, use the standard rules for casting through barriers, but if the spell’s Force is insufficient to beat the mana barrier it “fizzles” at the point of contact with the barrier.

If the spell reaches the chosen target and it fails to dodge with Quickness (+ Counterspelling, if available) ({Threshold} 10 + Spells Force), the target then resists damage with Toughness + armor. Each point reduces the Damage Value. The target takes the damage left over, if any after the Toughness and Armor Protection is deducted. Note that nonliving objects resist damage from an Indirect Combat spell with their Armor rating x 2 (see Barriers). Note that unlike other spells, Indirect Combat spells may affect other targets that the caster cannot see if they are caught within the spell’s area of effect.

**Elemental Effects**: Many Indirect Combat spells utilize damaging elemental energies such as Fire damage, Electrical damage, etc (see Damage Types).

Spells with elemental components also create secondary effects on the environment. For example, a Fireball might start fires, cook off ammo, ignite fuel tanks, and set fire to armor and clothing all over the blast zone. An Acid Stream can melt surrounding material into smoking sludge. These are noted in the special case damage descriptions.

**Damage Value**: The base Damage Value for Combat spells is based on Force in flat damage, which is chosen by the magician at the time of casting. Any Effect scored on the Spellcasting Test increase the Damage Value by 1D6 per Effect. Each spell description notes whether damage is Stun (S) or Physical (P).

### Detection Spells

Detection also known as Divination spells give the subject a new sense, beyond the normal five senses, for as long as they are maintained. They are cast upon either the magician or a subject within Touch range. Using the sense may require the subject to take a Minor Action to Perception in Detail. Detection spells are either directional (like normal sight), area effect (work in all directions at once, like hearing), or psychic (providing some other special “sense” such as telepathy or precognition). Additionally the sense is either active or passive (see below).

**Active**: The sense actively analyzes or seeks out certain information when the subject concentrates on it. Active Detection spells are treated as an Opposed Test, pitting the caster’s `Spellcasting + Magic vs. The target’s Willpower (+ Counterspelling, if available)`; magical objects resist with Force. Against objects, handle the spell as a Success Test with a {Threshold} based on the Object Resistance. The Detection Spell Results table provides guidelines for how thoroughly the sense works, based on Effect scored. Note that Counterspelling may be used to defend against active Detection spells, even if the magician is not aware of them (see Counterspelling).

**Passive**: A passive sense is simply “on” and passes along any appropriate sensory input without any sort of interpretation (similar to hearing). The Spellcasting Test serves as a magical Willpower test, against an appropriate {Threshold} determined by the gamemaster. Other effects are noted in the spell descriptions. The Detection Spell Results table provides guidelines for how thoroughly the sense works, based on Effect.

Note that Counterspelling cannot be used to “defend” against the sense provided by passive Detection spells.

**Range**: The standard sensory range for a Detection spell is the spell’s `Force x Magic` in yards. For extended range Detection spells, the effective range of the new sense is `Force x Magic x 10 yards`. Note that any of the standard range spells listed below may be learned with an extended range instead (adding +2 FV).

Note also that a separate test is not needed for each potential target in range of the sense. The character simply makes a single `Spellcasting + Magic Test` and compares the results against each potential target in range, using the Detection Spell Results table to determine the result. If a caster sustains a Detection spell, new targets may be detected as they enter the range of the spell; in this case, the gamemaster simply applies the results of the original `Spellcasting + Magic Test` to see if the new targets are noticed.

**Glitches**: A glitch on a Detection Spellcasting Test may result in false or misleading information. Likewise, a critical glitch may inflict extra (+2 FV) or Physical Drain, may temporarily strip the character of a sense, or may inexplicably apply the sense to others (particularly opponents) in range.

**Detection Results Table**
| {Threshold} | Results                                                                                                                                     |

- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2)

This spell allows the subject to analyze the purpose and operation of a device or piece of equipment within range of the sense.

Each Effect gives the subject a +1 while operating the device, and allows the subject to ignore any skill defaulting modifiers for using the device while the spell is sustained.


#### Analyze Truth (Active, Directional)
- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2)

The subject can tell whether a target’s statements are the truth. Halftruths or falsehoods the target believes to be true are not detected by this spell.

The subject must hear a statement in person (with the target within range) to know whether it is true.

#### Clairaudience (Passive, Directional)
- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) –1

The subject can hear distant sounds as if physically present at a chosen point within the sensory range of the spell. The “listening point” may be moved to any other point within range of the spell. While using clairaudience, the subject cannot use her normal hearing. This spell does not translate visual images, only sounds (and only sounds within the subject’s natural range of hearing; augmented hearing does not apply).

#### Clairvoyance (Passive, Directional)
- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) –1

The subject can see distant scenes as if physically present at a chosen point within the sensory range of the spell. The “visual point” may be moved to any other point within range of the spell. The subject cannot use normal vision or astral perception while using it. This spell does not translate sound, only vision. Any augmented vision possessed by the subject does not function through this spell, nor does astral perception. Magicians cannot use clairvoyance to target others with spells.

#### Combat Sense (Active, Psychic)
- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 2

The subject can subconsciously analyze combat and other dangerous situations within range, sensing events a split-second before they happen. Every Effect on the Spellcasting Test adds +1 Reaction on Surprise Tests and when defending against ranged and melee attacks for the duration of the spell.

The spell can detect targets preparing an ambush or other surprise attack.

#### Detect Individual (Active, Area)
- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) – 1

- Type: P 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) –1

The subject detects all of a specified type of object within range of the sense and knows their number and relative location. Each type of object requires a separate spell (Detect Guns, Detect Computers, Detect Explosives, and so forth).

#### Mindlink (Active, Psychic)
- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1

Mindlink allows the caster and one voluntary subject to communicate mentally, exchanging conversation, emotions, and mental images. One Effect on the Spellcasting Test is enough to establish the link. The subject must remain within range of the spellcaster for the Mindlink to work.

#### Mind Probe (Active, Directional)
- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 2

This spell allows the subject to telepathically probe the mind of a specific target within range of the sense (chosen when the spell is cast). The target is aware of the probing, though they may not know the source of the spell. If the caster gains one or more Effect, consult the Mind Probe Results table (below) for the information gained. The subject may probe for one piece of information per Major Action. Additional uses of Mind Probe against the same target within a number of hours equal to the target’s Willpower are at a –2 modifier per previous Spellcasting attempt.

**Mind Probe Results table**
| {Threshold} | Result                                                                                                     |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 15          | The subject can read the target’s surface thoughts only.                                                   |
| 20          | The subject can fi nd out anything the target consciously knows and view the target’s memories.            |
| 25          | The subject can probe the target’s subconscious, for psychological quirks, deep fears, or hidden memories. |

### Physical Health Spells

Physical Health spells can heal physical injury, cure diseases (or inflict them), detoxify poisons or drugs (or mimic their effects), as well as modify attributes. No techniques currently known to magic can erase Stun damage or cure psychological conditions.

All health spells require the caster to touch the subject of the spell. This “laying on hands” is traditional in magical healing lore the world over. Physical Health spells are handled as Success Tests, with Effect providing specified bonuses.

Negative Physical Health spells: Spells that negatively affect a character require an Opposed Test, pitting `Spellcasting + Magic vs. The target’s appropriate attribute (+ Counterspelling, if available)`.

#### Antidote

- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: P 
- FV: (Toxin DV) – 2

This spell helps a poisoned subject to overcome a toxin. It must be applied before the toxin does damage (though an Antidote spell applied afterward may alleviate some side effects, if the gamemaster chooses). The poisoned character receives a modifier on her Toxin Resistance Test (Stamina) equal to the Effect. 

#### Cure Disease

- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: P 
- FV: (Disease DV) – 2

This spell is used at any point after infection to help a patient overcome illness. The infected character receives a number of additional dice on her Disease Resistance Test equal to the spell’s Effect. It does not heal any damage already inflicted by the disease (that takes a separate Healing spell).

#### Decrease [Attribute] (Negative)

- Type: P 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1

This spell weakens the target by decreasing a chosen attribute. A version of this spell exists for each Physical and Mental attribute, but not for Special attributes (Initiative, Edge, Magic). It affects both natural and augmented attributes. The target resists the spell using the attribute affected. If the caster wins, the attribute is reduced by the spell’s Effect. If a Physical attribute is reduced to 0, the victim is incapacitated or paralyzed. If a Mental attribute is reduced to 0, the victim stands about mindlessly confused. Note that decreasing an attribute may affect other derived statistics.

#### Detox

- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: P 
- FV: (Toxin DV) – 4

Detox relieves the side effects of a drug or poison. The Force of the spell must equal or exceed the toxin’s base DV. A single Effect is sufficient to eliminate all symptoms. Detox does not heal or prevent damage done by toxins, but it eliminates any side effects they may have on the victim (dizziness, hallucinations, nausea, pain, and so forth). Detox is the hangover cure of choice among those who can afford it. 

#### Heal

- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: P 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) – 2

Heal repairs physical injuries. It heals an amount of Physical damage equal to the spell’s `Force + Effect from the Spellcasting Test`. Effect can also be used to reduce the base time for the spell to become permanent; each Effect spent this way shaves off 1 Combat Turn. A character can only be magically healed once for any single set of injuries. 

#### Hibernate

- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) – 3

The caster must touch a voluntary or unconscious subject. The spell puts the subject in a form of suspended animation. The subject’s bodily processes are slowed by a factor equal to the Effect. For example, If the Effect was 4, the subject’s metabolism is slowed by a factor of 4. Such a subject sealed into a chamber with enough air to keep it alive for a day would be able to last four days.

#### Increase [Attribute]

- Type: P 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) – 2

This spell increases an attribute (natural or augmented) on a voluntary subject. A version of this spell exists for each Physical and Mental attribute, but not for Special attributes (Initiative, Edge, Magic). The Force of the spell must equal or exceed the (augmented) value of the attribute being affected. The attribute is increased by an amount equal to the Effect scored. Each attribute can only be affected by a single Increase Attribute spell at a time.

Note that increasing an attribute may affect other derived statistics (Increase Reaction also affects Initiative, for example, while Increase Stamina will add extra boxes to the character’s Physical Condition Monitor for as long as the spell lasts).

#### Increase Reflexes

- Type: P 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 2

This spell increases the reflexes (Initiative) of a voluntary subject. Each level of increase adds +1 Initiative. The caster must achieve a certain Effect Threshold for each level:

- Effect 2: +1 Initiative
- Effect 3: +2 Initiative, +1 Major Action
- Effect 4 (max.): +3 Initiative, +2 Complex Actions

A character can only be affected by a single Increase Reflexes spell at a time.

#### Oxygenate

- Type: P 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) – 1

This spell oxygenates the blood of a voluntary subject, providing extra Stamina (+1 for every Effect) to resist suffocation, strangulation, the effects of inhaled gas, or any other effect of oxygen deprivation. The spell also allows the subject to breathe underwater.

#### Prophylaxis

- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) – 2

This spell provides additional Stamina (+1 per Effect) for a voluntary subject to resist infection, drugs, or toxins. The spell does not discriminate between harmful and beneficial drugs, so the subject also resists medicines and other helpful drugs while under the effects of the spell.  Reduce the effect of a beneficial drug by 1 for every Effect of the spell. Two or more Effect prevent the subject from being affected by alcohol while under the effect of this spell.

#### Resist Pain

- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: P 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) – 4

This spell allows the caster to have the same affect of the High Pain Threshold Quality for a number of rounds equal to the Force + Effect of the Spellcasting Test. 


#### Stabilize

- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: P 
- FV: (Overflow damage) – 2

When applied to a character who is at Physical Health 0 and dying, this spell stabilizes all vital functions and prevents the character from dying. The spell’s Force must equal or exceed the overflow damage already taken when the spell starts. The full time must be taken for the spell to become Permanent before the character is stabilized; Effect reduce the time it takes by 1 Combat Turn each. If successful, the spell prevents the character from taking further damage from Physical Damage Overflow.

### Illusion Spells

No matter how realistic they are, illusions cannot directly cause permanent harm. They can cause distractions, loss of balance or orientation, and even symptoms like nausea or pain. All such effects vanish as soon as the caster drops the illusion. Illusions can certainly cause harm by manipulating the senses so a victim walks into traffic or off a high building, for example, but they cannot directly cause damage.

Obvious illusions are used solely for entertainment and cannot fool subjects into believing they are real. Realistic illusions seem completely real. Single-sense illusions affect only one sense. Full sensory illusions affect all senses. Though mana-based illusions can be created on the astral plane, their magical auras give them away as illusions to anyone who makes a successful Assensing Test (see Astral Willpower). Illusions cannot fool assensing to disguise or create auras.

Mana Illusions: Mana-based illusion spells affect the mind and are ineffective against technological viewing systems like cameras. Mana illusions are resisted by Willpower + Counterspelling (if any). Some mana illusions affect the target’s senses directly, others affect the senses of anyone perceiving the subject of the spell (though the spellcaster is not affected by her own spell). 

Physical Illusions: Physical illusion spells create actual images or alter physical properties, such as light or sound. Physical illusions are effective against technological systems, assuming the caster achieves enough Effect to meet the Object Resistance Threshold. They are resisted by `Intuition + Counterspelling (if any)`; non-living devices do not get a resistance test. The spellcaster must generate more Effect than the observer for the illusion to be considered real. If the spell is not completely resisted, the character is fully affected by the illusion.

#### Confusion (Realistic, Multi-Sense)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2)


#### Mass Confusion (Realistic, Multi-Sense, Area)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 2


#### Chaos (Realistic, Multi-Sense)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1


#### Chaotic World (Realistic, Multi-Sense, Area)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 3


These spells produce a storm of conflicting sensations and images to confuse the senses. For each Effect on the Spellcasting Test, the target suffers a –1 modifier to all tests from the distraction. Confusion affects a single target. Mass Confusion is an area spell. The Chaos spell is a physical version of Confusion (above), so it also affects technological systems and sensing devices. Chaotic World is an area version of Chaos.

#### Entertainment (Obvious, Multi-Sense, Area)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1


#### Trid Entertainment (Obvious, Multi-Sense, Area)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 2


These area spells create obvious, but entertaining, illusions. Effect on the Spellcasting Test measure how creative, interesting, and captivating the audience finds the illusion. The caster can reproduce just about anything from her imagination, or re-create something she has experienced. The gamemaster might require additional hits for exacting detail. 

Entertainment affects the minds of the subjects and cannot be detected by non-living sensors. Trid Entertainment is a physical spell, and can be perceived by both living subjects and non-living sensors. These spells are used for amusement as well as art. The entertainment industry uses illusionists as literal “special effects wizards.” Magical designers and artists work to create new and interesting sensations, including sensations that can’t otherwise be experienced in the real world. Only the wealthy can afford the unique experiences offered by such spellcasters firsthand.

#### Invisibility (Realistic, Single-Sense)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2)


#### Improved Invisibility (Realistic, Single-Sense)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1


This spell makes the subject more difficult to detect by normal visual senses (including low-light, thermographic, and other senses that rely on the visual spectrum). The subject is completely tangible and detectable by the other senses (hearing, smell, touch, etc.). Her aura is still visible to astral perception. 

Anyone who might perceive the subject must first successfully resist the spell. Simply make one Spellcasting Test and use the result scored as the Threshold for anyone that resists at a later point. Even if the spell is resisted, the subject might remain unnoticed if she wins a Sneaking Test. An invisible character may still be detected by non-visual means, such as hearing or smell. Attacks against invisible targets suffer the Target Hidden modifier (disadvantage) if the attacker is unable to see or otherwise sense the subject of the spell. Invisibility affects the minds of viewers. Improved invisibility creates an actual warping of light around the subject that affects technological sensors as well.


This spell makes the subject more difficult to detect

by normal visual senses (including low-light, thermo-
graphic, and other senses that rely on the visual spec-
trum). The subject is completely tangible and detectable

by the other senses (hearing, smell, touch, and even

taste, if it somehow comes to that). Her aura is still visi-
ble to astral perception.

Anyone who might be in a position to perceive the
subject must first successfully resist the spell. Simply
make one Spellcasting Test and use the hits scored as
the Threshold for anyone that resists at a later point.
Even if the spell is resisted, the subject might remain
undetected if she’s good enough with her Sneaking Test. An invisible character may still be detected by non-visual means, such as hearing or smell. Attacks against invisible targets suffer the Blind Fire modifier if the attacker is unable to see or otherwise sense the subject of the spell.

Invisibility affects the minds of viewers. Improved Invisibility mimics the subject’s surroundings from all angles and affects technological sensors as well.

#### Mask (Realistic, Multi-Sense)

- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2)


#### Physical Mask (Realistic, Multi-Sense)

- Type: P 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1


The Mask spell requires the caster to touch the subject. The subject assumes a different physical appearance (of the same basic size and shape) chosen by the caster. This alters the subject’s voice, scent, and other physical characteristics as well. Anyone who might see through the disguise must first successfully resist the spell. Simply make one Spellcasting Test and use the result scored as the {Threshold} for anyone that resists at a later point.

Mask affects the minds of viewers. Physical Mask creates an illusion that affects technological sensors as well.

#### Phantasm (Realistic, Multi-Sense, Area)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) +2


#### Trid Phantasm (Realistic, Multi-Sense, Area)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) +3


These area spells create convincing illusions of any object, creature, or scene the caster desires. They can create an illusion of anything the caster has seen before, from a flower or a credstick to a dragon breathing fire, as long as the illusion is no larger than the spell’s area. Anyone who might pierce the illusion must successfully resist the spell. Simply make one Spellcasting Test and use the result as the Threshold for anyone that resists at a later point. Phantasm only affects living beings, while Trid Phantasm affects technological sensors as well. 

#### Hush (Realistic, Single-Sense, Area)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 2


#### Silence (Realistic, Single-Sense, Area)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 3


These spells create an area that damps sound. Sonic attacks into or out of the field, as well as critter powers using a sonic medium (such as Paralyzing Howl), are reduced by –1 per Effect on the Spellcasting Test. Anyone attempting to hear a sound from within or across the silenced area must successfully resist the spell.

Hush is a mana spell and so only affects living beings and magic sonic attacks. Silence affects technological devices and is useful for jamming alarms, detection devices, sonar, and tactical communications, as well as technological sonic weapons.

#### Sneaking (Realistic, Single-Sense)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) +1


Sneaking makes the subject less audible to normal hearing (including augmented hearing). The subject moves in silence, making less or no noise. Things not directly touched by the subject can still make noise, so a character under a Sneaking spell would make no noise knocking on a door, but the door would make noise hitting the floor or wall if it was kicked in.

Anyone who might hear the subject must first successfully resist the spell. Simply make one Spellcasting Test and use the result scored as the Threshold for anyone that resists at a later point. Even if the spell is resisted, the subject might remain unnoticed if she wins a Shadowing or Infiltration Test.

### Manipulation Spells

Manipulation spells control, animate, or transform matter and energy.
Many Manipulation spells have a Threshold; this is the number of
Spellcasting + Magic hits required for the spell to function. Mental
Manipulations affect the mind, Physical Manipulations affect physical
forms, and Environmental Manipulations affect conditions such as
light, temperature, gravity, etc. Most Manipulation spells are handled
as Success Tests, with hits determining the effect.

Mental Manipulations: For Mental Manipulation spells, the caster makes an Opposed Spellcasting + Magic Test against the target’s Willpower (+ Counterspelling, if available). If the caster scores more hits, she controls the target as noted in the spell description. Every (Force) Combat Turns, the victim may spend a Major Action to shake off the mental control. the victim rolls a Willpower (+ Counterspelling) Test; each hit reduces the Effect on the caster’s original Spellcasting Test. If the spellcaster’s Effect are reduced to 0, the spell no longer affects the target.

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S

protects against Physical damage. It provides both Ballistic and Impact
armor (cumulative with worn armor) to the subject equal to the hits scored.

- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2)

#### Mob Control (Mental, Area)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 2

the caster of this spell controls the physical actions of a target like a puppeteer pulling strings. the victim’s consciousness is unaffected, but the
caster controls the victim’s body. the target uses any skills or abilities at
the caster’s orders, but these tests suffer a  modifier equal to the
target’s Willpower because of the victim’s resistance to the caster’s commands. Controlling a target character requires the caster to spend a Simple
Action; when not directly controlled, the victim may act as normal.
Control Actions only affects a single target, Mob Control affects
any living targets within the area of effect. Victims of a Mob Control
may be manipulated individually (with separate Minor Actions) or
issued the same command as a group (with a single Minor Action).

#### Control Emotions (Mental)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2)

#### Mob Mood (Mental, Area)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS (A)

- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 2

the target feels an overwhelming emotion chosen by the spellcaster (such
as love, hate, fear, joy, sorrow, and so forth). the target believes the emotion
wholeheartedly, but not mindlessly. A target who acts in accordance with
the emotion (for example, fighting while filled with anger or hate) suffers
no penalty. If the target takes action not relevant to the emotion (trying
to drive while laughing hysterically), she suffers a –2  modifier
for the distraction. the caster may switch emotions with a Minor Action.
Control Emotions only affects a single target, Mob Mood affects
any living targets within the area of effect.

#### Control Thoughts (Mental)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 2

target does. the caster mentally gives commands with a Minor Action
and the target is compelled to obey

Control thoughts affects a single target, while Mob Mind affects
any living targets within the area of effect. Victims of a Mob Mind may
be manipulated individually (with separate Minor Actions) or issued
the same command as a group (with a single Minor Action)

#### Fling (Physical)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: I 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1

this spell psychokinetically hurls a single object of no more than
(Force) pounds at a designated target with a Strength equal to onehalf the spellcaster’s Magic. Treat the Spellcasting Test as a normal
Ranged Combat Test for the purposes of the item hitting the target.
throwing weapons propelled by this spell use their normal range based
on the spell’s effective Strength.

#### Ice Sheet (Environmental, Area)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: I 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 3

yard per minute in normal temperatures.

#### Ignite (Physical)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: P 
- FV: (F ÷ 2)

the Ignite spell accelerates molecular motion in the target, causing it
to catch fire once the spell becomes permanent. the spellcaster must
achieve enough Effect to beat a Threshold equal to the target’s Object
Resistance. Once the target ignites, it burns normally until it
is consumed or extinguished.
Against living targets, treat Ignite as an Opposed Test pitting
Spellcasting + Magic vs. Stamina (+ Counterspelling). If successful,
Ignite wraps a living target in heat and flames once it has been made
permanent, causing (Force) boxes of Fire damage on the first
Combat Turn, and increasing by one box of damage each additional
turn. Resolve the damage at the end of each Combat Turn by making
a Damage Resistance Test using the victim’s Stamina + half Impact armor.
Ammo or explosives carried by a victim may go off. the gamemaster
should reduce the Force of the fire accordingly for extinguishing efforts 



#### Influence (Mental)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: P 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1

this spell implants a single suggestion in the victim’s mind, like a powerful post-hypnotic command. the subject will carry out this suggestion as if it were her own idea and it will then fade. If confronted with
the wrongness of the suggestion, the subject can make a Willpower
Test to overcome it as described under Mental Manipulations.
the caster can also withdraw the suggestion at any time.

#### Levitate (Physical)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1

Levitate allows the caster to telekinetically lift a person or object and
move it around. the caster must achieve a Threshold on the Spellcasting
Test equal to 1 per 200 kg of the subject’s mass. the subject of the spell
can be moved anywhere in the caster’s line of sight at a Movement rate
equal to the spell’s Force x net Spellcasting hits in yards per turn.
Objects flung into other things should be handled as a Ranged
Attack Test (see Fling), inflicting a number of boxes of Stun damage as
decided by the gamemaster (especially sharp or dangerous objects may
do Physical damage at the gamemaster’s discretion).

If the caster is attempting to levitate an item held by a living being,
make an Opposed Test between the spell’s Force x 2 and the holder’s
Strength + Stamina. the caster must have at least 1 net hit to levitate the
item away. If the caster is attempting to levitate an unwilling living
being, the Opposed Test uses the target’s Strength + Stamina. You can use
this spell to levitate yourself, if desired.

#### Light (Environmental, Area)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) – 1

this spell creates a mobile point of light, illuminating a radius around
it equal to the spell’s Force in yards. the spell cannot be used to
blind, but does offset darkness visibility modifiers. Each hit on the
Spellcasting Test counters a –1 die penalty for visibility.

#### Magic Fingers (Physical)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1

Magic Fingers creates a psychokinetic effect like “invisible hands” that
can hold or manipulate items. the hits on the Spellcasting + Magic
Test become the spell’s effective Strength and Agility. the caster can use
skills remotely with Magic Fingers, but all tests receive a –2 
modifier due to problems of fine control. Even simple actions like picking up a coin may require an Agility Test, at the gamemaster’s discretion.
the caster can fight, pick a lock, or perform any other action,
using the magic fingers as if they were real hands. the spell can reach
any point the caster can see, and Clairvoyance or remote-viewing technology can be used to get a close-up of the scene as long as it is within
the caster’s normal line of sight. this spell comes in very handy for disarming bombs and handling other hazardous work from a safe distance.

#### Mana Barrier (Environmental, Area)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1

Mana Barrier creates an invisible barrier of magical energy with a Force
equal to the Effect scored. this barrier does not restrict living beings
or physical objects, but it does impede spirits, foci, dual beings, and
spells. If cast on the astral plane, it also impedes astral forms and restricts visibility. Any target of a spell that is on the other side of the
Mana Barrier receives a bonus to its spell resistance  equal to
the barrier’s Force. If the target had no resistance , but instead
has an Object Resistance Threshold, increase the Threshold by 1 for
every increment of 3 Force in the Mana Barrier (round up). 

#### Petrify (Physical)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 2

Petrify transforms living tissue into stone-like calcium carbonate. the
caster must win an Opposed Test pitting her Spellcasting + Magic
against the target’s Stamina (+ Counterspelling). Additionally, the spell’s
Force must equal or exceed the target’s Stamina. Non-living material—
including clothing, gear, and cyberware—is not affected. the target
is not conscious while under the effects of this spell, and any damage
suffered by the stone-like form affects the target normally. While petrified, the subject has a barrier Armor rating equal to Stamina + Effect
(see Barriers).

#### Physical Barrier (Environmental, Area)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 3

Barrier spells create glowing, translucent force-fields with both 1 point
of Armor and Structure rating per hit (see Barriers). the caster
can form the barrier as a dome with a radius and height equal to the 
spell’s normal radius. the caster can also form a wall with a height and
length equal to the spell’s Force. the caster can adjust size of the barrier
the same as the radius of an area spell .
Physical Barrier creates a physical wall. Anything the size of a molecule (or less) can pass through the barrier, including air or other gases.
Anything bigger treats the barrier as a normal physical wall. Attacks
directed through a barrier have a –1  visibility penalty. the
barrier does not impede spells. the barrier can be brought down by
physical attacks, but as long as it is sustained it regenerates damage
quickly—any reductions in Structure Rating are restored at the beginning of the next Combat Turn. If the barrier is penetrated, however,
it collapses and the spell ends. Physical Barrier cannot be used on the
astral plane.

#### Poltergeist (Environmental, Area)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 3

Poltergeist picks up all small objects (up to a kilogram in mass) within
the spell’s area and whirls them around in random patterns. this imposes a –2  visibility penalty in the area. the spell inflicts
2 boxes of Stun damage (resisted with Reaction + Impact armor) to
anyone in the area each Combat Turn, whacking them with flying
debris. Poltergeist may do more damage in cluttered environments, or
inflict Physical damage if the gamemaster feels the debris is sufficiently
dangerous (broken glass and nails, for example).

#### Shadow (Environmental, Area)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1

Shadow creates a globe of darkness with a radius equal to the spell’s
Force in yards. Every hit imposes a –1 die pool visibility modifier
against targets within the area (maximum –6).

#### Shapechange (Physical)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 2

#### (Critter) Form (Physical)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1

Shapechange transforms a voluntary subject into a normal (non-paranormal) critter, though the subject retains human consciousness. the
subject can only assume the form of a critter whose base Stamina rating
is 2 points greater or less than her own. Consult the Critters section, for the subject’s Physical attributes while in critter form. Add 1
to the critter’s Base attribute Ratings for every hit the caster generates.
Her Mental attributes remain unchanged.
this spell does not transform clothing and equipment. Magicians
in critter form can still cast spells, but cannot perform other tasks requiring speech.
Critter form works like the Shapechange spell, but only allows the
subject to change into a specific non-paranormal animal. Each critter
form is a different spell (Eagle Form, Wolf Form, and so on)

#### Turn to Goo (Physical)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 2

Turn to Goo transforms living tissue into a sticky, glue-like substance.
the caster must win an Opposed Test pitting her Spellcasting + Magic
against the target’s Stamina (+ Counterspelling). Additionally, the spell’s
Force must equal or exceed the target’s Stamina. Non-living material—
including clothing, gear, and cyberware—is not affected. the target
is not conscious while under the effects of this spell, and any damage
suffered by the gooey form affects the target normally. the goo has a
barrier Armor rating equal to Stamina + Effect.




## The Matrix

The Grid is the physical network of all computer systems interconnected by the world telecommunications system. If a computer is connected to any part of the Grid, then it can be accessed from any other part of the Grid. With the exception of some technicians, however, most people refer to the world-wide computer network as the Matrix.

In 2053, hard-core computer systems users, those whose work entails sifting, sorting, and routing vast and complex amounts of data, do not simply use their computer system. They inhabit it.

Matrix technology places the user inside a computer-generated simulation of the computer system known as a virtual reality. Everything in the Matrix is a graphic (visual) representation of some physical component (like a datastore or processor), a program (like a data-sifting browse program or an intrusion countermeasures program), or an action (like copying a file, changing a code, and so on). The computer operator of 2053 does not sit in some cubicle in some department somewhere staring at a computer screen and typing away, along with hundreds of other wage slaves. The operator's physical body may be in such a cube, but his senses are inside a wondrous neon and chrome symbolic representation of the data with which he is working. A good analogy might be to actually being inside a video game. The data moves and changes in response to the operator's mental commands, the Matrix technology translating his or her thoughts (with some physical, keyboard-based assistance) into computer-system commands. Instead of having to remember countless keystrokes and command words to get the work done, the computer operator just does it. Compared to his or her counterparts of the late 20th century, work is easy.

**ACCESSING THE MATRIX**

There is only one way Into the Matrix, and that is with a "Matrix imaging Cybernetic Interface Device," or cyberdeck. Other interface devices still exist, but they are old tech. The cyberdeck Is the only choice for someone who wants an edge. Leave the big, ugly, slow stuff to the corporate wage slaves.

To connect into the Grid, all decks have a fiber-optic cable with a standard data plug like those found on home telecom systems. With the right tools, a decker can drop a neat little tap into any existing comm line to accommodate that plug. All that remains is to power up the deck, jack into it, and go. The deck connects to its user either via an electrode net that slips over the head (the way of cowards), or with a direct cybernetic Interface through a datajack (the only way to fly.) Some deckers still use some form of keyboard assistance, but many prefer running with a pure cybernetic hook-up.

The deck, once activated, overrides most of the user's own sensory information and replaces It with an electronic simulation known as simsense. The simsense ( "simulated senses") signal translates the complex code-structures of the actual Grid Into the graphic representation of the Matrix. The deck, knowing that the user's signal is traveling through a dataline, feeds the user a simsense signal that makes it look (and feel) like the user is zooming down a neon tunnel. When the decker Is about to enter the vast computer systems of Fuchl Industrial Electronics, for example, the deck gives that system the appearance of a giant, five-pointed chrome star many thousand times the size of the decker. Fuchi's computer system does not actually look like a chrome star, but thanks to the cyberdeck, that is what the decker sees.

**ENTERING THE MATRIX**

After a second of disorientation, the decker (that is, the Matrix image of the decker character) appears in the Matrix at the point where the cyberdeck tapped into the Grid. If he enters from an Illegal tap In the back room at Matchstick's Bar&.. Grill. the decker's image will appear in the telecom line that serves the joint.

The decker appears standing next to the deck· s construct. ( In the Matrix, the representations of physical systems, such as a computer system, a node, or even a cyberdeck, are referred to as constructs.) It is usually a small. white pyramid that looks the same as a licensed, legal cyberterminal. It can assume any shape the decker wants, but most deckers like to keep a low profile, and so they leave the appearance of their entry point as is. On the other hand, some of the really hot deckers don't give a drek whether or not they get spotted. The late, great St. Louis Blue used to Image his deck construct like a carnival tent with a neon sign that said "lhis deck belongs to the meanest dude in the Matrix." (Damn shame about old Blue.)

Usually, the decker plugs into the Local Telecommunications Grid, or LTG. The LTG is the equivalent of an area code in an antique telephone system, providing connections to all the phone systems (and computer systems) within that area code. Getting Into the LTG Is easy. It's only when the decker wants to travel to another part of the Grid, or to any computer system linked to the LTG, that things get interesting.




**EXITING THE MATRIX**

A decker can leave the Matrix any time by jacking out, pulllng
the plug that connects his datajack to the deck. Keep in mind that the
decker's Matrix-image, the persona, is only a program running on the
computers of the Grid. The persona does not really go anywhere and
has no Independent consciousness. Despite decker legends, one
cannot get "trapped" In the Matrix.

A decker kicked out of the Matrix Involuntarily has been dumped.
The rapid cutoff of the deck's slmsense signal can cause the decker to
experience mlld disorientation called dump shock. This lasts up to 30
seconds, during which time the character Is disoriented. Dump shock
adds +2 to all target numbers for the duration. The character can make
a WIiipower Test against a Threshold 4 to attempt to throw off
the effects, dividing the number of successes Into 30 seconds to
determine the actual amount of time he or she Is disoriented. Every
3 seconds, or part thereof, is one Combat Tum.

If fighting against black IC. the decker must make a WIiipower
Test against a target number equal to the rating of the IC. This requires
a Simple Action.


**Dumpshock**

When you’re disconnected from the Matrix without gracefully jacking out, you suffer a nasty shock as your sim module kicks out. This happens to hackers so often that it has its own name: dumpshock. The Damage Value for dumpshock is 3S. Dumpshock is biofeedback damage, so you resist it with Willpower. As if that weren’t enough, you’re also suffering the Stunned Condition (10 – Willpower) minutes, even if you manage to soak all the damage.

### IC

Intrusion countermeasures (IC) are software programs installed in a system to protect that system's information from unauthorized users. Intrusion countermeasures may be installed in any node with a Security Code of green or higher. "Ice," as it is colloquially pronounced, makes life difficult for deckers. Some IC tries to make life impossible for deckers. E.very IC system has a rating, which Is usually its "skill."

There are three classes of IC: white, gray, and black. White IC offers passive resistance. Gray IC actively attacks intruders or traces their entry point into the Matrix. Black IC tries to kill deckers. E.ach is described in the following sections.

##### WHITE IC

White IC is primarily concerned with identifying and locating intruder persona programs. White IC is so called because it is not harmful in itself. though it may activate other countermeasures that are downright deadly.

If white IC is satisfied that a persona program may legitimately be in the area, it will do nothing. (E.ach type of white IC has its own requirements for "satisfaction," as described below.) If the IC is not satisfied, it will signal a passive alert on its next Action. The white IC will check the identity of the persona program again, and If it is still not satisfied, it may trigger an active alert.

Generally, the process goes something like this:

1. Intruding persona program moves into contact range. (As long as the persona stays beyond contact range. the IC pays no heed. Usually.)
2. The persona program must then attempt to fool the white IC into believing it, the persona, is a legal signal. Again, see each type of white IC for the types of programs that are effective against It.
3. If the persona succeeds, the IC lets it pass. The persona program continues on.
4. If the persona fails to fool the IC, the IC will signal a passive alert. It will then attempt to verify the identity of the intruder again. If it cannot, an active alert is triggered and any gray or black IC present will activate

White IC cannot defend itself against an attacking persona program. White IC that survives to its next Action Phase while under attack will trigger an immediate active alert. A decker can try to jam the IC by using dice from his Hacking Pool. This requires a Simple Action and prevents the IC from activating an alert on its next Action Phase. Make a test with Hacking Pool dice using the IC's System Rating as the target number. The IC makes a test against the persona program, using its own rating for the number of dice rolled, and the persona's Masking Rating as its target number. If the IC wins, it triggers the alert.

If a persona does not immediately attempt to use a deception or sleaze program upon entering contact range, the IC will initiate the verification attempt on its next action.

##### GRAY IC

Gray IC Is more dangerous than white IC because It can actually damage a deck or Its user. Unless an analyze program Is used successfully, gray IC resembles white, In that the Sensor Attribute of the deck recognizes both programs as IC. Gray IC usually requires a trigger, which Is often white IC. Once activated, however, It needs no further prompting. If the gray IC In a node Is donnant and the white IC present Is fooled by the persona program, the gray IC will not activate.

When already active, gray IC will move to Interrogate a persona program as soon as the icon moves to within sensor range of the node where the gray IC is currently located. Some paranoid corporations place active gray IC In Isolated systems where sensitive data Is stored. They often place the IC In the SAN, particularly when most legitimate users do not have to cross through the SAN to use the data in it (they enter the system though 1/0Ps in the same duster as the data). All gray IC is mobile.

##### BLACK IC

Black IC Is so named because it attacks the decker, not his deck. Black IC nonnally does Physical damage, but can be programmed to do Stun damage If the system owner Is In a good mood. Remember, dead men tell no tales, but prisoners can be downright talkative.

Black IC Is activated In the same way as gray IC. Black IC Is most certainly mobile.

Deckers not using a cybernetic link are Immune to the damaging effects of black IC. Sure, a tortoise (see p. 177) can stand up to the punishment, but he's got to get to the black IC In the first place. Once black IC scores a hit, the decker may either hang tough or jack out.

### System Rating

Everything that can be hacked has a System Rating. This generally runs from 6-12, although there is no upper limit. A truly high-level system (like a military command center) might have a system rating of 17 or higher. The system rating acts as both a threshold for the number of hits required to affect the system and as a condition monitor if attacked in cybercombat, with the number of boxes in the condition monitor equal to its rating. In the case of vehicles and drones, use the Pilot Rating and add 5. In the case of other items, the rule of thumb is to set the item’s system rating at 1/2 its body, rounding up.

Generally, subtract the program's Rating to get your Adjusted System Rating.


### Cyberdecks and Condition Monitors

Cyberdecks have a physical condition monitor (representing the physical condition of the deck) and a detection condition monitor (representing the Decker’s ability to avoid detection whilst hacking). When the physical condition monitor is boxed out, the deck is destroyed. 


### Persona Programs

The following are the core programs used by Deckers:

- Exploit: Reduces the threshold of a system rating for gaining access or information.
- Spoof: Reduces the threshold of a system rating for giving commands.
- Purge: The “medic” program – erases data from the cyberdeck. Adds its rating to the Decker’s `Logic+Electronics Test `for eliminating harmful viruses (including Traceroute).
- Sleaze: Passive program – its rating equals the number of boxes of the cyberdeck’s detection condition monitor.
- Analyze: Reduces the number of tests on the Extended Test for the search
- Armor: Passive program. Adds its rating to the Decker’s Logic Test to resist damage in cybercombat.
- Attack: The program used to perform attacks

#### Resetting the Detection Condition Monitor

The Detection condition monitor does not “heal” as long as the Decker is jacked into the system in which he suffered the “damage.” Deckers do not simply jack out and jack back in once they are close to detection. Once the Decker jacks out of that system and performs a purge (a major action requiring a `Logic + Cracking (12)`), his deck’s Detection condition monitor resets and all the damage inflicted on it is “healed.”

### Examples

Example: Hacking the cameras to hide the team’s presence

A shadowrunner team is infiltrating a research facility. Sam the Decker has a 5 Logic, a 5 Cracking Skill, and a rating 5 Cyberdeck. All of his programs are also rating 5 (these are purchased but cannot exceed the Deck Rating).

The shadowrunners need Sam to hack the facility’s security cameras so that they can enter the facility undetected. Sam is already jacked into the matrix and is within wireless range of the system. The system rating of the node controlling the security cameras is 9. Sam subtracts his Exploit program rating of 5 from the system rating of 9 and ends up with an adjusted system rating of 4 making the Threshold 24. Sam rolls `3d6 + 15` and gets 25 with a 5 on the Effect Dice, successfully hacking the node. The cameras do not record the shadowrunners entering the facility. The GM rules the Effect results in 5 minutes of them being removed from the cameras.

Sam then must resist Detection, rolling his Logic of 5 and the Hardening of his Deck (also of 5) against a threshold of 24 (the adjusted system rating). Sam rolls 18 with a 3 Effect Dice so failed the test. The Rating 4 Syatem does 4 Damage compared to his 3 Effect Dice leaving 1 left over, he crosses out one box on his Detection condition monitor. Until he jacks out of the system, performs a purge, and his detection monitor resets, Sam is going to suffer a -1 penalty to all future Matrix skill rolls.

Since he is already in, Sam decides to shut down the cameras by Giving a Command

### Cybercombat

#### Matrix Actions

##### Major Actions

- Give a Command (Spoof)
- Hack in (Exploit)
- Search the Matrix (Analyze)
- Brute Force (Attack)
- Crashing the System (Engage the system in Combat)
- Purge The System (Purge)

##### Hack In

Whenever a Decker attempts to interact with an object with a system rating, he rolls `Logic + Cracking + his Cyberdeck’s rating`.

The threshold for his test is the system rating of the system he is attempting to hack. The Decker’s Exploit program rating helps the Decker by lowering the system rating’s threshold for this test by its rating (i.e., a Decker hacking a system rating 8 would subtract his Exploit program’s rating of 5, meaning that the actual threshold for the Hacking test is 3). This keeps the focus on the Decker’s skill rather than his gear, as the Decker modifies his programs on the fly to best suit his needs. This new System Rating (the original minus the Decker’s Exploit program rating) is known as the adjusted system rating.

To get the Threshold required multiple the Adjusted System Rating X 6. So In the above example of a Rating 8 system with an Exploit program of 5, resulting in an Adjusted System Rating of 3 means the Threshold for the Hacking test is 18. 

##### Give a Command

You attempt to tell the system to do something. This is rather open ended but things like open a door, unlock something, download a file, delete a file, etc. Crashing the System is a separate function and will engage the systems Countermeausres.

`Logic + Cracking + Cyberdeck Rating ([System Rating - Decker's Spoof] X6)` Roll for Effect

Effect carries over as a Bonus on The Detection Test Below

Please Note if you fail the Detection Test you will likely be engaged by whatever IC on the system.

##### Search The Matrix

Often times you need to search the system for the Node you need to access. This is an extended test.

`Logic + Cracking + Cyberdeck Rating (12,[Rating - Analyze],1 Major Action)`

You can apply Effect Dice as additional successes on each roll to finish faster OR to use on your Detection Test.

Roll Detection after each Extended Check.

##### Brute Force

This is the action to attack either the System itself or IC that has been dispatched to take you out. 

White IC does Physical Damage to the Deck. Your deck could get bricked.

Black IC does Physical Damage to the Decker themself. You could die.

This trigger Initiative. Whoever wins attacks first.

An attack roll = `3D6 + Cracking + Logic + Attack Rating vs. IC/System Rating + 10` roll for effect. 

Damage Value = Attack Rating + Effect.

The target will reduce damage by Hardening + Armor Rating, any net damage will attack the Condition Monitor as appropriate.

No need for a Detection test during combat, you are detected.

Example Sam engages has hacked into Seattle General Hospital, he is trying to shut down all the cameras in the building but has been detected. The system activated White IC to deal with him. 

Sam rolls Initiative `[Intuition (3)+ Cyberdeck Rating (5)] + 2D6` getting a 7 on the roll for a total of 15. 

Seattle General is a Orange System it rolls `Rating (6) + 3D6` getting a 10 for a total of 16. The IC goes first. 

White IC attacks Sam, `3D6 + Rating (6) + Attack Rating (6)` for a total 22, Sam's Defense is `10 + Cyberdeck Rating` or 15 so he got hit, the White IC effect dice was 5. The White IC did 11P damage to the Cyberdeck 

Sam's Deck has Hardening of 5 and an Armor Program of 5 so he is able to resist 10 points of the damage but still takes 1 Box of damage on his Cyberdecks Condition Monitor putting him at -1 to all rolls. 

Sam's time to counter, he rolls `[3D6 + Cracking (5) + Logic (5) + Attack (5)] -1 for Condition` for a total of 24 the defense for the IC is 16, his Effect Dice is 3. For a total Damage Value of 8. 

White IC has no Hardening or Armor programs. So it resists 6 points of the damage and takes 2 Boxes of Damage putting it at -2 to its rolls.

... Combat continues. 

##### Crashing a system

Instead of hacking a system, a Decker can attempt to crash it. This is done by attacking the system in cybercombat. The system rating is the system’s condition monitor and also serves as the modifier the system adds rolls to defend itself against cybercombat (much like a Body attribute on a physical object in the real world). Crashed systems do not function until they are rebooted. Authorized Deckers can reboot a crashed system with a minor action. A system cannot be crashed if there is an active defender (Agent, Sprite, or enemy Decker) present.

Crashing a System will dump everyone out of it with Biofeedback.

#### Step 1. Determine Initiative

Decker: `Intuition + Cyberdeck Rating + 2D6`

1 Major, 1 Minor Actions a round

| System | Initiative |
| ------ | ---------- |
| Blue   | No IC      |
| Green  | 2D6        |
| Orange | 3D6        |
| Red    | 5D6        |

#### Step 2. Declare Action

The player declares what they want to do. 

#### Step 3. Resolve Action

#### Step 4. Detection Test

##### The Detection Test

Using a similar approach to magic, after a Magician casts a spell, he then resists drain. After a Decker performs a hack, he then resists detection. This mechanic represents the Decker’s skill at evading detection whilst hacking a system. To do this, the Decker must resist a number of hits equal to the adjusted system rating. The Decker rolls his `Cracking skill + Hardening + Effect Carry Over` rating of his deck. On success there is no damage to the Decks Detection Condition Monitor. On Failure compare the difference in Effect Dice with the Adjusted Rating of the System and the deck will take Detection Condition Monitor damage of the difference (minimum 1) **and** any Deckers or agents in those nodes are instantly aware of the hacking Decker’s location and cybercombat is very likely imminent.

###### Glitching the Detection Test

If a Decker glitches on the Detection Test, the IC of the system has noticed something is wrong and begins to interfere with his presence. This is represented by a basic chart that establishes a rule of thumb—the GM may always decide on something else happening and certain systems (such as ones used in an adventure) can have their own custom response chart.

- Glitch on a System Rating 6-9: The Decker is hit with a Traceroute attack program with a rating equal to the adjusted system rating.
- Glitch on a System Rating 10-12: The Decker is hit with a White IC attack program with a rating equal to the adjusted system rating. IC does physical damage to the Deck itself.
- Critical Glitch on a System Rating 6-9: The Decker is ejected from the system and may suffer dumpshock.
- Critical Glitch on a System Rating 10-12: The Decker is hit with a Black IC program with a rating equal to the adjusted system rating. Black IC does physical damage to the Decker themself.


#### Step 5. Next Round
