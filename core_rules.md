## What is SIRE?

SIRE is a Ability Dice Code TTRPG system created by CJ Schrum to be a generic system used to play any kind of TTRPG. It was influenced by his near thirty years of table top games in nearly every ruleset created. 

> I used to play FATE I liked a lot of things about FATE, I hated FATE dice mechanics. I played a lot of Cepheus, Traveller, Decipher Star Trek, ModernAGE, West End Games Star Wars, and Sixfinity so lets say I have a lot of experience with D6 in my hands. So I set out to create a fairly generic style RPG using Ability Dice Code (I like the curve better than the standard distribution of 2D6). Allowing for Advanatage Roll Ability Dice Code twice take highest, and Disadvantage Roll Ability Dice Code twice take the lowest. They also have Edge Points they can spend.
> Combat is meant to be cinematic in style with a tactical flavor. Characters have Physical Health.

## Chapter 1: Character Creation 
{{Write a Definition}}

### Attributes
Each Attribute has a Die code (1D, 1D+1, 4D, 9D+2 or some other number). Reading a die code is simple. Roll the number of six-sided dice before the "D". For example 3D means roll three dice and add them together for the total. The higher the total the more likely you are to succeed. A die code with a "+" means add the number after the plus to the total. Ability Dice Code+2 you would roll three dice, then add two to the total. For example if you rolled a 3, 5, 1 the total would be: 3+5+1+2 for a total of 11. Die codes will have either a simple D (1D, 2D, 3D, etc). Die codes will never have more than a +2 after them, as when a character improves that Die Code it goes to the next whole number of dice. For example if you improve Ability Dice Code+2 it will become 4D6. The only limit to how high a Die code for attributes can go is the Metatype Attribute maximum.

This sysem is used for skills (see skills) as it will limit your skill rolls to the potential available to your attribute.

| Score | Dice                |
| ----- | ------------------- |
| 1     | 1D6                 | 5  | 0  |
| 2     | 1D6+1               | 5  | 1  |
| 3     | 1D6+2               | 5  | 2  |
| 4     | 2D6                 | 10 | 3  |
| 5     | 2D6+1               | 10 | 4  |
| 6     | 2D6+2               | 10 | 5  |
| 7     | Ability Dice Code   | 15 | 6  |

There are six attributes and four special attributes.

---

**Physical Attributes**

---


**Body**

This represents the general sturdiness, integrity, and health of the individual. It sometimes is correlated to size—trolls tend to have high Body ratings— but this is not a perfect correlation, as dwarfs tend to have higher Body ratings than humans. Body’s uses include resisting damage and toxins.

**Quickness**

Quickness represents fine motor control—manual dexterity, flexibility, balance, and coordination. A character with a low Quickness may be someone with an inner-ear problem, one leg that is shorter than the other, or a simple klutz. Higher Quickness ratings may belong to charac- ters that are “natural” athletes.

**Strength**

Strength denotes what a character’s muscles can do, including things such as raw lifiing power and running speed. Strength is some- what dependent on a character’s size and metatype. If your character is a 5’3” tall, 115-pound human girl, she’s unlikely to possess an un- augmented Strength attribute of 6. On the other hand, dwarfs have a muscle density that rivals that of reptiles. Characters with low Strength may be small, skinny, or slight, or simply too busy to work out. A high- Strength character may be tough and wiry, know how to use her body to her best advantage, work out every day, or simply be fraggin’ BIG.

---

***Mental Attributes**

**Charisma**

Charisma is a nebulous attribute. More than just looks, Charisma rep- resents a character’s personal aura, self-image, ego, willingness to find out what people want and give it to them, and ability to recognize what she can and can’t get out of people. A whiny demeanor, a me-first attitude, or an inability to read body language or subtle hints are just a few traits that can give a character low Charisma. A character with high Charisma might simply enjoy entertaining others, may excel at making friends and/or manipulating people, or may be all flash and fun with whomever it is today. A high-Charisma character might deliver jokes at the right moment, have a sexy way of carrying herself, or com- mand respect because her timing is always impeccable.


**Intelligence**

Intelligence represents a character’s memorizing ability and raw brain- power. It denotes how fast a character learns, how much she can re- member, and how well she can execute pre-planned sequences. A Intelligence-lacking character might get overwhelmed when confronted with a lot of details and may have a poor memory—especially for facts and figures. Characters with a high Intelligence rating will likely be excellent book-learners, able to deal with computer and magic theory with ease, and capable of building (and tearing down!) machinery and electronics. 


**Willpower**

Willpower keeps a character going when she wants to give up, or enables her to control her habits and emotions. Willpower determines whether or not a character is going to take charge of her life. A charac- ter with low Willpower might defer to other people when big decisions are being made, for example. A high-Willpower character is more as- sured and possesses a never-say-die streak. Such characters go down to the monowire because that’s exactly the fragging point. Willpower also represents a character’s cool under fire, her ability to resist intimida- tion and manipulation, and her resolve to stick to her guns when the
pressure is on.

---

**Special Attributes**

Please note Resonance is not used in Sixfinity if it is referenced ignore it.

**Magic**

Not all characters have this attribute; it is only for magic-using characters, who are generally referred to as Awakened characters. It measures their strength in channeling mana into spectacular effects.

**Edge**

This critical statistic measures the undefinable, putting it on tricky ground right at the outset. It is that combination of guts, risk, and heedless ignorance of danger and good sense that lets shadowrunners survive where others do not. Edge is detailed and important enough to have its own section

**Reaction**

A character’s Reaction is, quite simply, her physical reflexes—how quickly she can react to a changing situation, and how well she can dodge the physical slings and arrows that shadowrunning brings. A character with a high Reaction is more likely to be on top of a situation and will be in a better position to react to danger, while low-Reaction characters will lag behind.

Reaction = (Quickness + Intelligence)

**Essence**

All characters have this attribute, starting at 6. It is a measure of how many augmentations characters can hold. The metahuman body can only contain so much ’ware before it loses the small spark that separates a living being from a machine. This attribute primarily exists due to the degrees of difference between biology and technology—it simply does not flow well through technology and becomes limited as your Essence declines (specifically, anytime your Essence goes below any whole integer, you lose a corresponding point of Magic or Resonance). Also, some magic, particularly healing magic, has less of an effect on you as you gain more augmentations. Finally, if your Essence ever reaches 0, you die


---


### Priority System

In Sixfinity character generation is based on the Priority System. The Priority System is a table with the following columns: Metatype, Attributes, Magic, Skills, and Resources. The rows are divided into Priority Levels ranging from Priority A to Priority E. Players assign a specific Priority Level for each of the columns to their character depending on their preferences. The values assigned must be different for each column (representing each aspect of the character), and there can be no duplications. For example, a character may not have Priority Level B for Magic and Priority B for Resources. The higher the Priority Level (A, B, etc.), the more valuable it is for the character. Characters use Experience later on to customize their characters even further.

The player begins the character-creation process by choosing their character’s metatype, or metatype. There are five distinct races within the core Sixfinity system, gamemasters are welcome to add or replace them: dwarfs, elves, humans, orcs, and fomori. Each metatype receives different racial advantages (and possibly disadvantages). Humans, for example, receive a higher rating in Edge (+1). Formions receive Thermographic Vision, +1 Reach (1 square), and Dermal Armor, but they also have the disadvantage of having their Lifestyle costs doubled to reflect the costs of adapting everything they use—especially their gear, to meet their massive physical requirements. Several metatype also receive physical or mental advantages/disadvantages to their attribute ratings (such as higher or lower natural attribute limits). When determining which metatype best fits the character concept they wish to play, the player should refer to the Metatype Attribute Table (below) and review the specific details for each metatype.

Once the player has selected the metatype they wish to play, they should review the Metatype column to determine which Priority Levels give them the best options for their character based on their preferred metatype and the special attribute points they need. The special attributes are Edge, and Magic; if you want your character to have a high rating in one or more of these areas, make sure you select a row with plenty of special attribute points.

Regardless of Priority all starting characters get 25 Experience to spend on their character to flesh them out, make then unique.

**Priority System Table**


| Priority | Heritage | Attribute Points | Magic              | Skills | Resources |
| -------- | -------- | ---------------- | ------------------ | ------ | --------- |

| B        | Orc      | 18               | Magic:4, 7 Spells  | 30     | 275k      |
| C        | Dwarf    | 16               | Magic:3, 5 Spells  | 24     | 140k      |
| D        | Elf      | 14               | Magic:2            | 20     | 50k       |
| E        | Human    | 12               | -                  | 18     | 6k        |

**Metatype Attribute Starting and Maximum Values**

**Step Nine**

Final Touches and Derived Stats.

### Derived Stats

#### Defense
We use Defense Rolls to Defend Attacks. 

Defense = Roll + Reaction

#### Physical Health

Physical Health = (Body Dice Code x4) x 4.


If you had a Body of 2D6 you you would have 32 Health. You add the Pips after the fact.

If yo uhad 2D6 +2 you would have 34 Health.

Once you reach 0 health you are unconcious and begin bleeding to death. You can bleed until you max your Overflow and then you are dead.

#### Stun Health

Stun Health = (Willpower Dice Code x4) x 4

This is where Stun Damage is recorded. If it reaches 0 you fall unconcious and any further damage begins to affect Physical.

#### Overflow

This is how far into the Negatives you can go before you die. 

Overflow = Body Dice Code X 4

If you had a Body of 2D6 you would have an Overflow of 8

#### Movement

Base movement for any character is 10 Yards.

#### Initiative

Initiative is used to determine who goes first in combat. Add your Reaction for your base, then write how many Initiative Dice you have. You start with a default of 1; this may be increased by augmentations. It looks like this when written: 9 + 1D6

Initiative = Reaction + 1D6

#### Edge Pool

Edge Pool = [((Quickness Dice Code + Intelligence Dice Code + Willpower Dice Code) + Pips) / 2] Round down. 

So if you had a Quickness od 1D6 +2, Intelligence of 2D6, and Willpower of 2D6+2, you would have a Edge Pool of 6 =  (1+2+2) + 3

#### Composure (Willpower + Charisma)

When the stress is running hot, the gamemaster can call for a test to see if you keep your cool. The gamemaster sets the threshold, and the player makes the roll to see if they stay engaged or start freaking out. Note that repeated exposure to certain types of situations reduces the need for Composure tests in those situations

#### Judge Intentions (Willpower + Willpower)

Sometimes you just need a roll to get a read on someone. The Judge Intentions test is just that. Once you’ve had enough time to get a read on someone (as judged by the gamemaster), you can make a roll to help fill in your basic attitude and feelings toward the target. Just remember that a good part of Mr. Johnson’s training is dedicated to getting you to trust them when you shouldn’t.

#### Memory (Intelligence + Willpower)

Most of us don’t remember our lives with one hundred percent clarity. We’re influenced by the mood at the time we formed a memory, the current mood, the presence or absence of memorable stimuli, or even slight oddities in the details. Then you have the tricks our mind plays in distorting memories to make us the heroes of our own story, and things get really weird. When it’s time to make a withdrawal from the memory bank, the gamemaster sets a threshold based on the age and complexity of the information, and you can roll to determine whether or not you recall the information you want. It may be about remembering a face, recalling a critical piece of information, pulling up a detail from the past that will help you understand what’s happening in front of you right now, or some other mental feat.

#### Lift/Carry (Body + Willpower)

As any professional powerlifter or crossfit champ will tell you, it’s not all in the muscles. You need the will to persevere in order to pull that little extra bit for the big efforts. Whether it’s pulling a comrade out of danger or flipping a car to cover your getaway, this is going to be the roll when there’s a question on whether or not it can be done. Characters can lift `[(Strength x Strength) x 20]` pounds naturally; if they need to raise the weight over their head, the multiplier drops to 10. Making a Lift/Carry test increases your effective Strength by 1 per net hit. It also does 1 Stun damage, resisted by Body. The damage increase by +1 each combat round you continue holding or carrying the weight.

### Character Advancement

In this game you spend your experience you gain at the end of the sessions to increase your charatcer during downtimes. 

Raising attributes is based on what the modifier not the base score. So to increase your Strength that is +3 to +4

| Desired Effect                               | XP Cost         |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------- |

## Chapter 2: Metatype

### Humans (homo sapiens sapiens)
- Average height: 5'6
- Average weight: 140 pounds
- Ears: Rounded
- Known for: Average size; average build; freaking out about people who don’t meet their averages
- Racial qualities: Humans have no extra racial qualities.

As the majority of the sentient beings of the world, humans create existing definitions of “normal,” and then some of them set out to abuse those definitions as hard as they can. These humans know that they lack the pure physical strength and social cohesion of some of the other metatypes, so they shape the world in a way that keeps the individuals they don’t like from ever realizing what they can do, and what they can become. The side effect of this, of course, is that many humans are caught up in the demoralizing machinery that the ruling corporate class has assembled, because they don’t fit into this artificial average. They are grist for the mill, people to be chewed up and spat out in the name of greater wealth and power for the people at the top. Because they’re humans, and there are so many of them, who’s going to notice how they’re ground down, and who is going to miss them when they’re gone? The shadows are full of humans who could not find a way to be normal or average.

### Elves (homo sapiens nobilis)
- Average height: 1.9 yards
- Average weight: 80 kg
- Ears: Pointy
- Known for: Slender, lithe build; being attractive and knowing it
- Racial qualities: Elves have low-light vision

Perhaps the most infuriating thing about elves to the other metatypes is that you can resent them like hell, and they just won’t care. They have two prosperous nations—Tír na nÓg (formerly known as Ireland) and Tír Tairngire (in the western part of North America)—they have people in some of the most powerful positions in the world, and celebrities whose MeFeed hits are in the billions. They are envied, not looked down on. But plenty of elves know that this envy does not extend to every elf. If you’re an elf who is not rich, elegant, or graceful, you’re often viewed as a failure, someone who had all the gifts of life handed to them and somehow screwed them up. And it’s not just nonelves who hold this view. Never mind that you might have grown up poor, never mind what obstacles you had to face—people think you automatically had it easy because you’re an elf. But elf society is not easy to survive. The upper crust can be absolutely ruthless about enforcing their status quo, labeling those who don’t fit as malcontents and finding ways to cast them aside. The barrens of the major sprawls of the world have plenty of elves who were thrown out because they wouldn’t cave to what society wanted them to be. Their anger could burn the whole earth.

### Dwarfs (homo sapiens pumilionis)
Average height: 1.2 yards
- Average weight: 54 kg
- Ears: Slightly pointy
- Known for: Short size; stocky build; perseverance
- Racial qualities: Dwarfs have thermographic vision and toxin resistance.

Sixth World dwarfs are often accepted into mainstream society without being fully valued. The taller metatypes seem to be happiest when dwarfs fit the roles they have preconceived for them— sidekicks, drivers, mechanics, that sort of thing. It doesn’t help that their size helps them squeeze into vehicles that orks, humans, and elves might have difficulty with, ones that trolls couldn’t even consider using. Still, they get work and little direct hate. They’re treated nicely, but they can’t help but feel that they’re being, well, overlooked. Dwarfs across the globe are dedicated to showing that they cannot be ignored. Dwarf deckers, street samurai, covert ops specialists, faces, and more are popping up in the international shadows, and others underestimate them at their peril. The lack of heightened antipathy against dwarfs helped them assimilate in human communities better than other metatypes. This means that they do not have as many of their own enclaves as some of the other metatypes (it also doesn’t help that they don’t have access to whatever stream of revenue the elves tap into build their kingdoms). With the founding of the dwarf-centric Biloxi Technical Institute, southern Mississippi in the CAS is becoming a dwarf haven. What that will grow into and how that will shape the world is anyone’s guess.


### Orks (homo sapiens robustus)
- Average height: 1.9 yards
- Average weight: 128 kg
- Ears: Pointy- Known for: Big, powerful physique; tusks; constantly being seen as outsiders
- Racial qualities: Orks have low-light vision and the Built Tough (1) quality

Orks make people nervous, and people don’t like to be nervous. Their tusks, bone structure, and pointed ears mark them as something altogether else, and their strength and size clearly show the damage they could do. As humans have done for centuries, they address the thing they fear by pushing them aside, keeping orks from building collective strength, and crushing them with the sheer force of numbers. That approach works as long as you can keep fear stoked and have it immobilize the masses. Because if people can move past the fear and start to understand the deliberate injustice that has been forced on some groups, they separate themselves from society’s machine, and the number of people used to enforce oppression gets smaller. Oppressors aren’t especially good at developing new solutions to such problems— they usually just resort to oppressing harder. So while realization of the injustices they deal with is spreading, orks across the Sixth World are preparing for things to get worse so that they can survive and set about the work of making things better. They already have some enclaves carved out for themselves— Seattle’s Underground, Atlanta’s Sweetwater Creek, Dharavi in the Indian Union—and they hope those locales will be the starting points for societies that include orks instead of fearing them.


### Trolls (homo sapiens ingentis)
- Average height: 2.5 yards
- Average weight: 300 kg
- Ears: Slightly pointy, often hidden by horns
- Known for: Being so big, you guys. Just huge. And horns.
- Racial qualities: Trolls have thermographic vision, the Built Tough (2) quality, and dermal deposits (which provide +1 to trolls’ Defense Rating).

It’s not easy to live in a society where you look like the walking embodiment of everyone else’s nightmares. Being two to three times as large as everyone else doesn’t help much, either. It’s not a troll’s world, and most of the other residents of the world aren’t inclined to change that fact. Who wants to make space for imposing monsters? Trolls are going to have to force their way into a place in the world—of course, when they force their way in anywhere, they’re inevitably called vandals and destroyers. A significant number of trolls have looked at the way the deck is stacked against them and decided they don’t need to play the rest of the world’s game anymore. They’ll stand aside and watch the world burn—and maybe throw on an extra match every now and then. The Black Forest Troll Republic is one of the most important troll communities in the world, acting as a beacon and vision for what troll society can be while keeping a certain distance from everyone else. Whether they assimilate or build a higher wall is an open question. Trolls have the most difficult time adapting to other metatypes because their bodies are so different. It’s more than just the size and the horns— they have dermal deposits all over their bodies that make knobs, bumps, and other formations. They scrape up furniture and clothing, and make some people think twice about giving a troll a big bear hug. Especially since there are few people who can wrap their arms around a whole troll.




## Chapter 3: Contacts & Allies

A shadowrunner who goes it alone is often one
that winds up in a lonely, solitary grave. Experienced
shadowrunners build a network of people who can
provide the information and goods critical to their
work. Maybe it’s a bartender who knows the people
in their neighborhood, or an arms dealer who can get
the ammo that doesn’t flow through legal channels,
or a Lone Star officer who likes to shoot the breeze
about who just got arrested. These people and more
can be reached out to in times of need.

## Chapter 4: Rules

The rules center around rolling three six sided dice. One of those dice **must** be of a different color this dice is called the "The Effect Dice" this dice will add drama, excitement, and moments of unpredictability in the game. 

### How does it work?

Nearly everything is a TEST or CHECK. 

Result = Ability Dice Code + Skill Rank

You compare this result to a Threshold (below)

### Thresholds
A Threshold is the minimum number needed to succeed at a task. Threshold Step is used very often in these rules. A threshold step is used instead of giving the Threshold Target (or TN in other games) to allow the Gamemaster to alter the Targets as they see fit for their game without needing to alter the writing in the rules to maintein balance.

For example if a character needs a `Biotech + Intelligence (2) test` in Sixfinity Standard rules they need to roll *at least* a 9 on Ability Dice Code. If a GM decided they wanted that to be a 10 they do not need to change anything just tell the character they succeeded or failed without having to make any adjustments to the rules. This is the same as using the word Simple but the Step makes it easier to explain to a player. This is inspired by a number of 80's games like Traveller, Gamma World, Shadowrun 1e where the target number on dice could change. This allows for some GM's who want to, to easily swap to a D20 and use 5/10/15/20/25 for their TN's and go looking for Dragons in Dungeons if they want.

If you are assining a test and the only thing that matters is their Effect on the roll feel free to make it a Step 1 test. 

| Difficulty | Step | Threshold Target |
| ---------- | ---- | ---------------- |
| Easy       | 1    | 6                |
| Simple     | 2    | 9                |
| Average    | 3    | 12               |
| Hard       | 4    | 18               |
| Very Hard  | 5-6  | 24               |
| Extreme    | 7-8  | 30               |


### Rolling Max Roll
When you roll a nautral maximum on your dice (6 on 1D6, 12 on 2D6, 18 on 3D6, etc.), you get a free Edge Dice. This means it is harder to push extra effort with more skill.

#### Glitching

Also called a Botch. 

When you roll all 1's on at least half your dive; this is called a glitch or a botch. As long as you still beat the Threshold provided you are able to get a success. However, something will happen that did not go according to plan this is ruled by the Gamemaster but some suggestions are things like gun jammed requiring a Minor A ction to clear it. We treat this as a "Yes but..." siutation.

What if you roll all 1's? In that case you have a Critical Glitch. Critical Glitches can be quite bad it depends on the GM a common rule during combat is that the gun is so fouled up it takes a Major Action or it may be completely out of commission until you can make a Mechanics check to repair it. This is treated as a "No and..." situation. A roll of 3 always fails.


### Effect
Effect is the most important part of the Sixfinity Engine. Effect determines how well things went or not. It is used throughout the rules and makes a lot of mechanics function. Additionally, it makes the Gamemasters life a lot easier as they can evaluate Effect in many cases.

#### Net Effect

Net Effect is calculated after a roll. It will always be the difference in two effect totals.

If it is needed in a Success Test the GM rolls and Effect Dice. You compare your Effect Dice (total if you got more than one) with the Effect Dice of the GM. Subtract the lesser from the greater and the net result is the Net Effect. Minimum 1.

In an opposed test you compare the Effect Dice of both sides. Subtract the lesser dice number from the greater dice(s) number and the net result is the Net Effect which goes to whoever won. Minimum 1.

### Advantage and Disadvantage
If used in text or a GM can use as shorthand.

Advantage: You get a free Edge Dice for this test.

Disadvantage: You cannot spend Edge on this Test.


### Success Tests
In a Simple test, you roll `Ability Dice Code + Skill`, and see if you meet total or beat a Threshold established by the gamemaster. The gamemaster establishes the Threshold based on the Threshold Guidelines and suggestions and guidelines established within the rules. If the the total is equal to or greater than the threshold, the action succeeds; in some occasions, the number of effect (the number on the Effect Dice) comes into play.

Written as `Attribute + Skill (Threshold Step)`

Such as `Agility + Firearms (2)` If you had a Agility of 2d6 you would roll `2d6 + Firearms skill`

This is a very important thing to understand - these are written as THRESHOLD STEP. This allows the Gamemaster to alter the actual dice Thresholds as they see fit without changing how a test works.

### Opposed Tests

In an Opposed test, another character, object, device, or entity is actively (or passively) resisting your efforts, so you must exceed their effort to succeed. In an Opposed test, two parties roll their dice and compare the number to the totals. The one with the highest total wins. Ties typically go to the aggressor, though this may change if net effect are required to make a given effect. The difference between the higher number of effect and the lower number of effect are the net effect in these tests, and they are often applied to the action in some way— for example, in combat, net effect from the attacker are added to the Damage Value of their attack.

Written as `Attribute + Skill vs. Opposed Attribute + Skill` These are rolled for higher roll. Then calculate Net Effect which will go to the winner.

### Extended Tests

Simple and Opposed tests involve actions that are taken and resolved quickly, generally in the course of a few seconds. Extended tests take longer and are for more complicated activities, like repairing an automobile or building a backdoor into a Matrix host. Extended tests have a modifier and a threshold like Simple tests, but they threshold does not have to be met on a single roll (and often can’t be) as it is a threshold *step*. The player can make multiple rolls of the dice,until they have accumulated enough total (totaling the totals from all their rolls) to meet or beat the threshold. With each roll, a certain amount of time passes. This time is known as the interval, and it is listed as part of each Extended test. 

Written as: Extended `Engineering + Intelligence (9, 1 hour) test`

### Attribute Only Tests

The gamemaster decides when an attribute-only test is called for and what attributes to apply. Attribute-only tests pair two attributes together to form a modifier, although there may be some situations where only one attribute applies. Here are a few attribute-only pairings built to suit situations where no skill suffices.

**COMPOSURE (CHA + WIL)**


Some situations are tough to deal with, even for hardened runners. When a character is faced with an emotionally overwhelming situation there are only two choices. Stay and fight or turn into a quivering lump of goo. To find out which one happens, make a `Willpower + Charisma` Test. Take note that repeating similar situations over and again eventually eliminates the need to perform this test. Staring down a group of well-armed foes will be scary at first, but after a character does it a few times the fear gives way to instinct.

**JUDGE INTENTIONS (CHA + INT)**


Reading another person is also a matter of instinct. A character can use their instincts to guess at the intentions of another person or to gauge how much they can trust someone. Make an Opposed `Intuition + Charisma` Test against the target’s `Willpower + Charisma`. This is not an exact science. A successful test doesn’t mean the target will never betray you (intentions have been known to change), and deceptive characters can gain another’s confidence easily. This primarily serves as a benchmark or gut instinct about how much you can trust the person you are dealing with.

**LIFTING/CARRYING (BOD + STR)**


The baseline for lifting weight is 30 pounds per point of Strength. Anything more than that requires a `Strength + Body Test`. Each Effect increases the max weight lifted by 30 pounds. Lifting weight above your head, as with a clean & jerk, is more difficult. The baseline for lifting weight above the head is 10 pounds per point Strength. Each Effect on the Lifting Test increases the maximum weight you can lift by 10 pounds. Carrying weight is significantly different than lifting weight. Characters can carry Strength x 20 pounds in gear without effort. Additional weight requires a Lifting Test. Each Effect increases the maximum by 20 pounds. For more details on carrying gear, see Carrying Gear.

**MEMORY (LOG + WIL)**


While there are numerous mnemonic devices designed for remembering information, memory is not a skill. If a character needs to recall information make a `Intelligence + Willpower` Test.

Glitches can have a devastating effect on memory. A glitch means the character misremembers some portion of the information, such as order of numbers in a passcode. A critical glitch means the character has completely fooled himself into believing and thus remembering something that never actually happened.

**RESIST KNOCKDOWN (STR)**


When you take more damage in a single attack than your Physical Limit x 3 you must avoid being knocked prone. Do this with a `Ability Dice Code + STR VS Damage Taken or 10 whichever is higher` success means you stay on your feet, failure you are knocked prone. If you take 30 damage in a single attack you are automatically knocked down regardless of the roll. 

**TOXIN RESISTANCE TEST (BOD + WIL)**


`Body + Willpower + the rating of any protective gear/systems`; each Effect reduces the toxin’s Power by 1 point. If the Power is reduced to zero, the toxic substance takes no effect; otherwise, apply the effect depending on the remaining Power level.

### Edge

Edge is a character’s luck, the favor of the gods, that unexplainable factor that allows her to beat the odds. The Edge pool is made from combining (Quickness + Intelligence + Willpower) dividing by three and rounding down.

So with a Quickness 5, Intelligence 3 and Willpower 3 that would be a 5 Edge Pool.

Spending an Edge Point adds an Effect Dice to your rolled dice, you add this dice to your total and your Effect. The most Edge that can be spent on a roll is equal to the Skill Rating in the Test being rolled.

So if you had an Edge of 4, and a Firearms of 3. You could add up to 3 Dice from your Edge Pool on a Firearms Test because thats the Rating of your skill. You can spend Edge **before** you rolle but not after. You can spend Edge on any Test in the game.

#### Refreshing your Edge Pool

- ALl of your Edge refreshes each day after a long Rest
- During Combat your Edge Refreshes every round.


### Individual Rule Sections

These sections are referenced in other locations in the book for how something works. This is the central repository for this information instead of scattering it all over the book in Combat, Equipment, etc. 

#### Direct Neural Interface or DNI

A direct neural interface, or DNI, connects your brain to electronic devices. Direct neural interface (along with a sim module) is required for VR use, but DNI is also useful for AR in that you don’t need any additional gear like earbuds or an image link to see or hear augmented reality objects. How do you sign up? You get DNI by wearing trodes, or having an implanted datajack, commlink, or cyberdeck. And if you’re using a sim module along with your DNI, you can get a sort of “super AR mode” where you can also feel, smell, and taste your AR experience.

#### Grenades

When throwing a grenade, choose a location as a target. Use a Throw Weapon Minor Action and make a Throwing Weapons + Quickness [Physical] (Threshold 18) Test modified for range and all the usual conditions. Success means the grenade lands right where you wanted. If you don’t meet the Threshold, the grenade scatters. The gamemaster determines scatter by consulting the Scatter Table (Determine Scatter). Hitting the Threshold on the test means no scatter, but it is still possible to hit the target if the scatter roll is low and the thrower got some Effect (see Determine Scatter). This all goes back to the old saying: “Close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades.”

Grenades are small, self-contained explosive or gasdelivery packages. They may come with a built-in timer to detonate after a pre-set amount of time (usually three seconds), a motion-sensor set to detonate on impact, or a wireless link set to detonate upon remote command. The type of detonation device determines the special rules and timing of grenade explosions.

Built-in Timer: This detonation method uses the attacker’s Initiative Score as the determining factor for detonation. The grenade is thrown during the character’s Action Phase and detonates in the next Combat Turn on the Initiative Score in which it was thrown minus 10, regardless of any additional changes to the thrower’s Initiative Score.

Motion Sensor: Grenades using a motion sensor are extremely dangerous. Once armed (about a second after the sensor is activated) the grenade explodes after any sudden stop or change in direction, meaning hitting the wall, floor, or target. This method uses the standard Ranged Attack rules but adds an extra step if it misses the target (no net Effect on the attack roll). After a failed attack roll, the thrower must roll for scatter and the grenade scatters the full amount before exploding immediately. A glitch on the attack roll means the grenade does not detonate on initial impact but instead doubles the scatter distance and explodes. A Critical Glitch means the thrower waited too long, and the throw sets off the grenade. The grenade detonates immediately, affecting the attacker and those around him. (Warned you it was dangerous.)

Wireless Link: This is the safest way to throw a grenade in some aspects, but it also comes with some risk and effort. The thrower (or anyone else who has a mark on the grenade) can detonate it by a wireless link. This requires the attacker to have a direct neural interface to the linked device and use the Change Wireless Device Mode Free Action. This method also reduces scatter. Without a DNI the attacker must use the Change Linked Device Mode Minor Action in their next or any of their subsequent Action Phases to detonate the grenade and scatter is not reduced.

##### Determine Scatter

If the attacker misses their intended landing spot, the gamemaster must determine the projectile’s scatter. The gamemaster determines the direction of the scatter by rolling 2D6 and consulting the Scatter Diagram. The 7 arrow indicates the direction of the launch, so a result of 7 means the projectile continued on past the target, while a result of 12 or 2 means the projectile scatters back in the direction of the attacker. Having determined the direction of the scatter, the gamemaster calculates the distance. The Scatter Table indicates a number of dice rolled based on the projectile, which is reduced by the number of Effect the attacker rolled. This is used to determine the final scatter distance. If the scatter distance is reduced to 0 or less, the projectile hits the target exactly. (Note that additional Effect do not add to Damage Values).

| Roll | Direction from Target |
| ---- | --------------------- |
| 2,12 | 6 oclock, south       |
| 3    | 8 oclock, SW          |
| 4    | 9 oclock, W           |
| 5    | 10 oclock,            |
| 6    | 11 oclock, NW         |
| 7    | 12 oclock, N          |
| 8    | 1 oclock, NE          |
| 9    | 2 oclock              |
| 10   | 3 oclock, E           |
| 11   | 5 oclock, SE          |


**Scatter Table**


| Type                | Scatter                            |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Standard Grenade    | (1D6 – Effect) yards               |
| Aerodynamic Grenade | (2D6 – Effect) yards               |
| Grenade Launcher    | (Ability Dice Code – Effect) yards |
| Missile Launcher    | (4D6 – Effect) yards               |
| Rocket Launcher     | (5D6 – Effect) yards               |

#### Grenade Launchers, Rockets, & Missiles

Occasionally, characters get their hands on military- grade hardware, like grenade launchers, missiles, and rocket launchers. Resolving a launched grenade, rocket, or missile attack is a two-step process. The first step determines where the projectile ends up in relation to the target (see Determine Scatter). The second step resolves the effect of the projectile’s explosion.

When you fire a grenade, rocket, or missile you use a Attack Major Action and roll a Heavy Weapons + Quickness [Accuracy] (Threshold 18) Test modified for range and all the usual conditions. Success means the launched weapon hits right where you wanted. If you don’t meet the Threshold, the projectile scatters. The gamemaster determines scatter by consulting the Scatter Table.

#### Blast Effects

Grenades, rockets, and missiles are area-effect weapons, meaning that their blast affects a given area and any targets within it. The farther away the target is from the explosive’s final location—the blast point—the less damage it takes, because distance reduces the effect of an explosive’s blast. Different grenade, rocket, and missile types lose blast effect at different rates. Consult the Grenades/ Rockets/Missiles Table to find the projectile’s Damage Code and Damage Value reduction rate.

#### TOXINS, DRUGS, AND BTLS

The Sixth World is a vicious place; it seems like something is always trying to do you harm. It’s not always a physical weapon, either. Sometimes it’s a fragging molecule or simsense program. Toxins come in a stunning array of forms in Shadowrun, some of them weaponized, some of them recreational. This section will deal with them. It opens with those toxins used primarily as weapons against the characters. Following those come the more recreational pharmaceuticals and their technological cousins. Then we finish up with rules and guidelines for substance abuse and addiction.

##### TOXINS

Knockout drugs. Truth serum. Nerve gas. All of these are examples of toxins, a catch-all term for a substance that’s mostly meant for use as a weapon, as opposed to recreation. Each substance has several attribute ratings.

**Vector**


This shows how the toxin is delivered to the target.

Contact toxins can be solid, liquid, or gaseous. They attack the victim through the skin. These toxins, if in liquid form, can be coated on a weapon. In this case, they can be applied with a successful Melee Attack, whether the attack causes damage or not. A chemical seal offers complete protection from this vector, unless it’s breached. Chemical protection gives a modifier equal to its rating to the target’s Toxin Resistance Test.

Ingestion toxins must be eaten by the victim. They can be solids or liquids. Since they must be eaten, they generally take longer to have an effect. Toxin extractor bioware provides a modifier equal to the rating of the augmentation to resist ingested and other toxins.

Inhalation toxins are applied as an aerosol spray or gas, and they must be breathed in by the target. Gas masks, chemical seals, and active internal air tanks provide immunity to inhalation toxins. Chemical protection gives bonus modifier to the Toxin Resistance Test equal to its rating.

Injection toxins must get into the target’s bloodstream, whether through a dart, hypodermic needle, or a cut. These can also be used to coat an edged melee weapon. They are applied to the target with a successful melee attack that causes damage.

**Speed**


This determines how quickly the victim suffers the toxin’s Effect. These effects are always applied at the end of a Combat Turn.



## Chapter 6: Skills

When trying to accomplish something more refined than hefting a load, spotting an
ambush, or running for cover, a character will normally use a skill. Shadowrun skills
are groups of closely related techniques and knowledge, not narrow, limiting areas
of function. The game takes this approach in an attempt to keep down the number
of statistics. If a character uses Concentrations and Specializations, he or she has
increased capability in that specialized area, but at the cost of reduced ability in the
rest of the functions covered by the general skill.

Skill do not have a linked attribute to them; as far as the rules are concerned Attributes do not aid in the total number for a skill.

### SKILL RATINGS

Skill ratings begin at a level of 1. There is no maximum rating, but players will
find it increasingly difficult to raise their character's skill ratings as the character
improves in a particular skill. Beginning characters may not start with any skill at
a rating higher than 6. Characters with no rating in a skill are considered untrained,
but they may still attempt to perform a function covered by a skill by defaulting to an attribute at penalty of rolling 2D6 instead of Ability Dice Code.


### SPECIALIZATIONS SKILLS

Having a Specialization in a skill will allow you to focus on a more narrow form of the skill. For example if you have Firearms 3 you can focus on Pistols. Which would be written as Firearms 3 (+2) to remind you of the Specilization. You can only have 1 Specialization per skill. A specialization allows a +2 on the roll. It does not raise the actual Rating so anything like Edge which is limited to the skill is still limited to the base skill. 

### Active Skills


Active Skills usually apply toward achieving a specific, shortterm result such as hitting a target with a weapon, performing a difficult maneuver in a vehicle, climbing a wall, casting a spell, and so forth. These skills also involve some form of active, physical activity

### Knowledge Skills


Knowledge Skills give a character access to specific Information. This is especially useful when the character is an expert In a fleld in which the player Is Ignorant. 

Many Knowledge Skills also provide the character with the theoretical basis of actions related to the fleld of study and the basis for new designs In an area.

**Languages**





### Defaulting

It is impossible to prepare for every scenario and only slightly harder to have every skill. When you perform an action without actually having the skill for the test, there’s still hope. You can default the skill, making the test using only raw talent. You don’t have any tremendous talent when you default— quite the opposite in fact. Defaulting imposes a –1 Dice penalty meaning you only roll 2D6 in addition to any other modifiers the situation demands. Unless the gamemaster feels that you’re at a complete loss when defaulting, you can use Edge and better your chances.


### Active Skill List

| Skill        | Example Specializations                  |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Arhcery      | Bows, Crossbows                          |
| Armed Combat | Blades, Clubs                            |
| Firearms     | Automatics, Pistols, Longarms            |
| Gunnery      | Machine Guns, Launchers, Vehicle Weapons |



## Chapter 7: Equipment

You’re only as good as your gear. It’s a common saying, but it’s true, especially on the mean streets of the Sixth World. Having the wrong gear at the right time or the right gear at the wrong time are both potentially fatal flaws. Either way you’re probably going to end up in a world of hurt, or worse.

### Gear Stats

The key functions of any piece of gear in Shadowrun are expressed in its game stats. The exact categories of stats depend on the item’s type. Cost is a universal stat—everything costs money—and all items also have Availability. We’ll cover that and some of the more specialized stats.

#### Availability

Availability expresses how easy it is to find a piece of gear. The higher the number, the more scarce the item is. Availabilities typically range from 1 to 6, but circumstances can push them up to 9.

Note that the top levels of Availability are primarily reserved for alphaware, betaware, and deltaware versions of augmentations.

Availability ratings give a general sense to the gamemaster of whether player characters can find a given item, but they also can be used in mechanics in two ways. First, the Availability rating can be used as a threshold in Matrix Search tests to find someone who carries the item—though the gamemaster should note that just because the players find a seller doesn’t mean that seller will be easily accessible. Second, players may ask a contact to locate an item. 

Generally speaking, contacts can find goods whose Availability is less than (not equal to) their Connection rating. Whether they connect the player characters to the gear is a question of Loyalty and role-playing.

**Availability**

- 1 These items can be found just about anywhere. If you’re in a relatively civilized area, just walk a few blocks, and you’ll find a place that sells this.
- 2 These items are a bit more specialized, but that mainly means you’ll have to seek out a store that focuses on this type of merchandise, rather than finding it in your local Stuffer Shack or whatever.
- 3 These are starting to be boutique items, the type of things aficionados seek out, or things that are made in relatively small batches. They’re not the rarest items, but they’re also not sitting in a ton of stores across the sprawl.
- 4 Now we’re getting into specialty markets. These are things not intended for mass markets, and their specialized function isn’t for everyone. Few people in any given sprawl carry them, and their supplies are limited.
- 5 True specialty items. These may be collector’s items or things deliberately made for a niche audience, but they are not at all easy to find.
- 6 These are quite rare, often hand-crafted items. Small workshops and specialty manufacturers make them, and you’ll never find them at a major retailer. Work hard, and you might track a by-appointment seller who will sell you one.
- 7 These items are not available off-the-rack. They are specially ordered and custom-made.
- 8 Same as 7, but you have to make an appointment to order one, and you may be subjected to a background check based on whatever obscure criteria the manufacturer has decided to assemble.
- 9 The most rare items money can buy—you just have to find the person who will take your cash. Owning one of these marks you as a member of the elite, and selling one of them brings in extra cash due to their scarcity.

#### Legality

Some items are listed with an (I) or (L) as part of their Availability rating. The former refers to items that are illegal for private ownership in most places, which means they are only allowed in the possession of security, megacorporate, or government entities. The latter designation is attached to items that require a license in order to legally possess or transport them. Licenses are bought and attached to SINs (or fake SINs). The legal status of any given item is dependent on the local laws. What’s legal in the UCAS may not be legal in CalFree, or vice versa. The listings here are for the UCAS and Seattle in particular, as the UCAS has several laws (like gun possession) that vary by state.

#### Active Program Slots

This shows how many programs an electronic device can have running at a single time.

#### Attack Rating


Close 0-3 yds, Near 4-50 yds, Medium 51-250 yds, Far 251-500 yds, Extreme 500 yds

#### Ammo

This is the ammo capacity a firearm has, as well as the type of container—(belt) belt, (c) clip, (cy) cylinder, (m) magazine, (ml) missile, or (z) muzzle loaders.

#### Armor Rating
This is a reduction in damage from incoming attacks land.

#### Blast
This is the size of a blast of an explosive.

#### Capacity
Some items can hold modifications and other
adaptations, and they have a Capacity rating to indicate
how much they can hold. Other items take
up this space—those items have a Capacity rating
listed in brackets [].

#### Damage Value (DV)
This is used for weapons and is the base damage
the weapon inflicts if it hits. It may have a letter
indicating its elemental damage, such as (e) for
electricity or (f) for fire. For explosives, this is listed
at different ranges, including ground zero (GZ),
Close, and Near ranges.

#### Device Rating
Used for electronic devices, this is a kind of
all-purpose stat that reflects the devices overall
power and systems integrity.

#### Essence
Used for cyberware and bioware, this shows the
Essence reduction you experience when installing
this item.

#### Modes
These are the firing modes firearms use.

#### Mount
This describes where an accessory is placed

#### Rating
If an item has a range of ratings in which it is available, it is listed in this column or next to the item’s name.

> Why isn't range listed? Because its a dumb concept in a TTRPG. I can hit a target with an AR-15 at almost a mile out. Basically if I can see it, its in range. Thats why. I love Gygax as much as the next guy but a Longbow fired by a professional can hit a target at a 100 yards easily which is also within site.

### Moving Gear

#### Standard Goods

Some general assumptions of item ownership come with the purchase of a Lifestyle. Basic clothing and doss furnishings would be included along with general amenities appropriate to the Lifestyle level. These items only need to be worried about when a character loses their Lifestyle or doss due to unforeseen circumstances, but they are replaced as soon as the runner buys a new Lifestyle.

#### Starting Gear

Runners use the funds they get at character creation to buy their initial gear. This includes arms, armor, tech, vehicles, and everything else that wouldn’t be a normal part of everyday life. These items should have some kind of note on where they are stored, because the runner could lose items if they keep them in their vehicle and it gets stolen, keep them at their base and it gets burned, or keep them on their person and they get pinched

#### Fencing Gear

Let’s make this simple. In order to fence the valuables you come across, you need a contact who’s in the right field (your bartender contact isn’t going to be the most useful helping you unload that cyberdeck prototype you lifted from Mitsuhama). If you have the right contact, you can get back ten percent of the base value on the item, plus one percent for every Effect on an `Influence + Charisma test (Avail)`. If the item is particularly hot or desired (according to the gamemaster’s discretion) the whole selling process could be more adventurous and offer a bigger payday, but that’s up to the individual running the show.

#### Concealing Gear

Sometimes you want to keep your stuff away from prying eyes. There is no active test for hiding gear—you put it in its carrier or holster or whatever and hope the equipment does its job. Spotting gear is based on a Concealability Threshold that is used in Perception tests. Items have a base Threshold based on their general size and shape; some items change this based on their design, whether they are built to be hidden or bulkier than normal and hard to make disappear. All these thresholds assume the item is being hidden by the owner—if you’re holding the item openly in your hand, the Concealability threshold would not apply.

| **SIZE**       | **Threshold THRESHOLD** | **EXAMPLE**             |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Large          | 0                       | Assault Cannon          |
| Bulky          | 6                       | Assault Rifle           |
| Tuckable       | 12                      | SMG                     |
| Pocket Size    | 18                      | Light Pistol            |
| Palm size      | 24                      | Deck of Cards           |
| Slim palm size | 24 + 2 Effect           | Single Card             |
| Palmable       | 24 + 3 Effect           | Lighter                 |
| Small          | 24 + 4 Effect           | 6 sided die             |
| Mini           | 24 + 5 Effect           | Stealth RFID Tag        |
| Fine           | 24 + 6 Effect           | Powder traces           |
| Microscopic    | 24 + 7 Effect           | A flea on your shoulder |

#### Size Cost Adjustments
Most gear is built to be used by humans, or at least human-sized creatures. Elves and orks are close enough to human sizes that they can generally make this gear work for them, but it’s not as easy for dwarfs and trolls. They usually need to shop at special stores or order their gear with certain customizations made to it. To account for this, dwarfs pay a ten percent markup on all the fitted gear they purchase. This applies to items like armor and clothes Size Cost Adjustments Most gear is built to be used by humans, or at least human-sized creatures.

This applies to items like armor and clothes

**Using Unadapted Gear**

Sometimes a dwarf or a troll has to use someone else’s stuff or make do with what’s handy. Any time a dwarf or troll uses gear that is not adapted for them, they suffer a –2 penalty on all actions involving that gear. This means armor doesn’t close right, guns don’t fit right, commlinks aren’t easy to use, etc

#### Wireless Functionality

Nearly every device is wireless. The wireless revolution started for tracking purposes, though most of the tracking was about observing consumer behavior. The corps also found it useful for inventory tracking and seeing how people used their goods. The only trick was finding a way to make sure consumers had a reason to keep the wireless functionality on at all times. That led to … the wireless bonus!

**Wireless Bonus**

Many items have a bonus applied when they’re kept attached to the Matrix. For the bulk of the population, this is just a little convenient aid in their normal life, but for runners it is often a door- die decision, because leaving your Smartgun XI linked to the Matrix could be the little edge you need, or it could be your doom as you get hacked and the fancy electronics-laden SMG becomes a paperweight. Items with a bonus are listed, and some have it listed for the entire category as well.

**Turning It Off**

Separating yourself and your gear from the Matrix is easy. An `Electronics + Intelligence (6) Test` as a Minor Action is all it takes in combat. The rest of the time, you can just assume you can figure it out as long as you have the Electronics skill.

**Throwbacks**

These devices are older tech. Whether it’s because they’re incompatible with the current Matrix or devoid of a way to interface with it, they don’t have a way to connect and gain any bonus from the wireless world. They also can’t be hacked in any way shape or form other than the other use of the word, like when a troll swings his axe and hacks your antique rifle in half.

#### Melee Weapon Descriptions

**BLADES**


Sharp edges provide the lethal advantage to everything with a blade. Brute force works, but elegant style is just as effective with objects honed to a razor sharpness.

**Combat axe**

Whether you’re Neal the Firefighter or Neil the Ork Barbarian, you can swing an axe for both utility and violence. The combat axe come with a single or double blade and a hardened spring-loaded thrusting point for breaking glass or providing an unpleasant surprise. In the overmuscled hands of a 2080s street warrior, this weapon can be far deadlier than a firearm.

**Combat Knife**

A simple, elegant, efficient killing device with a chisel point to make light work of armor. It’s also carbon-coated black, so no reflections give away your approach.

**Forearm snap blades**

Don’t like getting implants but still want three razor sharp blades to pop out of your forearm? This is the weapon for you. The blades extend and retract through either a forearm muscle command or a wireless signal. Either way, it takes a Minor Action. 

Wireless bonus: The blades grant an extra Minor Action on the turn when they are extended or retracted.

**Katana**

The iconic two-handed sword of the samurai is standard issue for trid-series shadowrunners. Out on the street, the deadly blade teaches lessons to those who think the trope is solely about looks.

**Knife**

A catchall term for a variety of different deadly fighting blades. The style is up to you, but the stats are all the same.

**Polearm**

Take a long stick, add any of a dozen varieties of blades to the head, and you’ve got a polearm. Designed to keep distance between attacker and defender or strike at a mounted target, they’re not common street weapons. They’re nearly impossible to conceal, even for a troll, but they’re great at keeping problems at a safe distance.

**Survival knife**

Specifically designed with a cutting edge on one side and a serrated sawing edge on the other, the true “survival” piece of this knife is in the handle and its collection of accessories. In the handle you’ll find a GPS monitor, mini-multitool, and micro- lighter. The blade is coated with a photovoltaic skin that blacks out the blade to prevent unwanted reflection; when charged, the skin can be activated to provide two hours of light. Combat stats are the same as the combat knife.

Wireless bonus: The knife displays an ARO of local maps and your GPS position, along with providing basic biomonitor data when in your hand.

**Sword**

A heavy blade on a one-handed grip that comes in a variety of styles. The world’s dominant combat weapon for thousands of years until the firearm came along.

**CLUBS**

**Club**

The stats listed can be used for a range of objects, including an axe handle, baseball bat, crowbar, tire iron, wrench, or even a two-by-four with a couple nails in it. The price listed is for a professionally made, old-style police baton, but it would be relatively easy to find one for free in a pinch.

**Extendable baton**

This telescoping club can be extended with a wrist flick or a wireless signal. In its retracted form, it’s easier to conceal (Concealability threshold 4 when retracted, 2 when extended). Retracting or extending it is a Minor Action. Wireless bonus: You gain a bonus Minor Action on a turn when you retract or extend the baton.

**Sap**

Also known as a blackjack, this is a short, flexible club or a leather-wrapped iron, lead, or sand filled sack for thumping heads. It’s designed to be concealable, often fitting in the palm of the hand (Concealability threshold 4).

**Staff**

Speak softly and carry a big stick. This is that big stick. Available in composite, hardwood, high-carbon steel, and other materials.

**Stun baton**
A riot-control staple and viewed as a symbol of corporate-government oppression, this handy electrical prod is still useful for everyone in the shadows. The stun baton holds ten charges and regains one charge per ten seconds when plugged in. 

Wireless bonus: The stun baton recharges without being plugged in, regaining one charge per half hour of wireless-enabled time.

**Telescoping staff**

A big stick that starts out as a small stick. This metal and composite staff can telescope down to the size of a stun baton or a sword. It can be extended and locked in place by spinning or snapping it out in each direction and giving the handle a twist to lock it. Or it can use a wireless signal to activate the telescoping effect. Extending or retracting it takes a Minor Action.

Wireless bonus: You gain a bonus Minor Action on a turn when you retract or extend the baton.

**EXOTIC**

**Bike Chain**

Go-gangs love to pull the old equipment off their scrap bikes and smack other people with it. These heavy metal chains are brutal weapons, esespecially when backed by the speed of a motorcycle. You gain a bonus Minor Action on a turn when you use the Trip Minor Action with this weapon.

**Knucks**

Everything from a roll of quarters in the palm (though who has that lying around?) to brass knuckles to Ares Hardliner Gloves, these weapons move a fist from potentially deadly to a probably deadly by augmenting the structure of the hand with metals or composites.

**Monofilament Whip**

Striking fear in the hearts of those who have warily watched its serpentine glow since the 2050s. In the hands of a trained user, this terrifying weapon can cut through armor, flesh, and bone as easy as butter with every millimeter of its two yards of monofilament line. In the wrong hands, or even with a bad twist of a skilled wrist, that line can send you to the street doc looking for a new limb. The whip is stored in the specially designed compartment in the handle with a small weight that detaches when the weapon is activated. Glitches are handled as usual, but a critical glitch always requires the wielder to resist the base damage of the weapon.

Wireless bonus: The whip uses your visuals on the target to make small adjustments in targeting, and the whip adjusts its trajectory. This increases the Attack Rating by 2. Also, the whip’s built-in safety system retracts automatically instead of hitting you on a critical glitch.

#### Projectile Weapon Descriptions

**BOWS**

**Bow**

Everything from the traditional longbow of fiberglass or wood to the modern compound bow. These archaic weapons aren’t common on the streets of 2080. They have the advantage of being hacker-proof as long as you leave off the fancy add-ons. Nocking an arrow takes a Minor Action (Ready Weapon). Bows have a rating that indicates the minimum Strength you need to use the weapon. The weapon’s rating is also used to determine damage (maximum rating is 14). Arrows also have ratings, and they must equal or exceed that of the bow.

**Crossbow**

Modern crossbows are designed with autoloading systems, internal magazines that hold up to four bolts, and come in light, medium, and heavy designs. Light models are single-handed, while medium and heavy designs require two hands.

**Injection Arrow/Bolt**

The injection arrow or bolt causes its base damage while also delivering a payload of one dose of a drug or toxin. A successful hit must deal at least one damage after the Defense Roll. Injection arrows and bolts come at a base rating of 8. Higher-rating models are available for heavier bows, but lower-rating models aren’t sturdy enough to deliver this heavier projectile.

Wireless bonus: The injection can be delayed until a wireless signal is sent. The injection also doesn’t need any damage; it just needs at least 1 net effect.

**Throwing Knives/Shuriken**

From stars to spikes and everything in between, these stats cover all the muscle-powered, small throwing weapons on the market. Up to (Quickness/2) of these weapons can be readied for throwing with a Ready Weapon action.

Wireless bonus: Successful hits leave wireless weapons in targets that can be used to predict movement patterns and offer an estimated location. A successful hit offers anyone wirelessly linked to the throwing weapon and using a smartlink system a +1 bonus for their attacks.




### Firearms

Leadslingers abound on the streets of 2080 (the name remains, even though lead rounds aren’t the norm anymore). For years, the streets managed to snag and use caseless rounds in order to stay clear of the law tracking them, but recent events have led arms manufacturers (a.k.a. the megacorps) to desire a tighter leash on their shadow assets, and cased ammo is becoming the norm once again, with each casing containing a microRFID to identify the weapon and location where it was fired. The glory of watching spent shells spinning through the air is back, and so are the back-alley reloads and scrubbed slugs to keep those of us in the shadows off the radar. Weapons are chambered for cased or caseless, with caseless ammo being marginally harder to track but tougher to find on the streets. 

Wireless bonus: All modern firearms are considered to be wireless-equipped and come with a digital ammunition counter and an ARO that tells you the ammo type loaded. If equipped with DNI, you gain a bonus Minor Action any turn when you eject a clip (for weapons that have them) or change fire modes (on models that have more than one).

#### Firearm Descriptions

**TASERS**
Pistols

Tasers accept top-mounted accessories.

**Defiance Super Shock**

This heavy-duty taser can fire up to four darts with twenty-yard-long wires. The wired connection to the battery allows for a more powerful shock but limits range. It can also be used point pointblank in Close Combat for the same damage. After a successful hit, if the target does not knock the lines free, the attacker may use a Major Action to inflict the base damage of the weapon again by opening another set of capacitors. 

Wireless bonus: A successful hit informs you of the status of the target’s basic health in terms of Condition Monitors (general statements, rather than exact number of boxes left).

**Yamaha Pulsar I/II**

The Pulsar uses wireless capacitors, meaning that the Pulsar has increased range compared to other wired tasers. As a trade-off, it packs a little less punch than wired models, but it fires faster and delivers repeated hits. The Pulsar I has no melee contacts, but the Pulsar II includes a pair of contacts on the base of the grip to use in melee (treat these as a Close Combat attack as a Club).

Wireless bonus: A successful hit informs you of the status of the target’s basic health and Condition Monitors (general statements, rather than exact number of boxes left).

**HOLD-OUTS**
Pistols

Hold-outs can’t take accessories or modifications.

**Fichetti Tiffani Needler**

Pretty and deadly are not mutually exclusive. Fichetti gunsmithing combined with Tiffani style makes the Needler the single most popular designer handgun in the world. The base model is matte grey, but its special color-changing coating can be manipulated via wireless signal with an infinite number of patterns and designs. The coating allows your gun to match your shoes, your handbag, or the camo pattern of your fatigues. The Needler only chambers caseless flechette rounds, which are already factored into its damage code.

Wireless bonus: You can change the color of the Fichetti Tiffani Needler with a Minor Action. Applying a camouflage pattern to the Needler increases the concealability threshold by 1 for visual Perception tests.

**Streetline Special**

Designed for cheap 3D nanoprinting, the Streetline Special is made of composite materials, making it harder to detect with MAD scanners (increasing the threshold to detect it by 1).

**Walther Palm Pistol**

Walther keeps the double-barreled derringer with the classic over-under design alive in the latter half of the twenty-first century with the Palm Pistol. Capable of Burst Fire by firing from both barrels at once, the limited ammo supply only offers a six-shot capacity—so tread carefully how often you go with a burst.

**LIGHT PISTOLS**

Light pistols can take top- and barrel-mounted accessories.

**Ares Light Fire Series**

The Light Fire Series is designed for special operators. The 70 is a street standard, while the 75 is not commonly available through regular dealers and standard legal channels. But what runner uses those? The integration of a barrel-mounted silencer in both designs makes the Light Fire series nearly trid-flick silent.

The 75 comes preloaded with smartlink hardware and software, and both come with a laser sight. The silencer for these models increases the threshold for audio Perception tests by 3 for the Light Fire Series when equipped and costs 750¥.

**Beretta T-series**

The preferred sidearm of many security forces around the world, the T-series is classified as a light pistol, even though the 201 design offers automatic fire capability, making it popular in nations that limit heavy and machine pistols. Since the frame is the same, it’s easier to disguise as a 101. The 201 also comes with a detachable shoulder stock, though it is often lost before the gun reaches the street market.

**Colt America L36**

A tribute to Colt’s world-class reputation, the L36 is cheap, easily concealed, and abundant on the streets. In order to be easily transferred between corporate security rookies, the weapon feafeatures an ownership swap feature that has been abused by cops and crooks alike. A perfect throwaway weapon.

Wireless Bonus: The user can alter ownership data with a Minor Action.

**Fichetti Security 600**

Designed as a light sidearm for security forces, the thirty-round magazine allows them to miss a ton and not worry about running out of ammo. This also makes it great for deckers. The Security 600 comes with a detachable folding stock and laser sight.

**Ruger Redhawk**

This rugged revolver is the kid brother of the legendary Super Warhawk. Designed with precision and fun shooting in mind, the Redhawk has a revolutionary single/double firing selector. Classic double action allows a shot with each trigger pull (Semi-Auto Fire), while the single setting lets you play old-west gunslinger and “fan” the hammer (Burst Fire).

Wireless Bonus: You get an extra Minor Action in a turn where you change the action selection.

**Machine Pistols**
Automatics

Machine pistols can take top- and barrel-mounted accessories.

**Ares Crusader II**

High capacity and comfortable styling make the Ares Crusader II a standout in its class. The Ares brand is synonymous with functionality, and the Crusader II integrates a gas-vent recoil compensation system and comes standard with smartgun systems and software preloaded.

**Ceska Black Scorpion**

Small and lethal, but not designed for beauty. Burst Fire capable from the get-go, it also comes equipped with an integral folding stock.

**Steyr TMP**

A lightweight polymer-frame and full autofire capability are not an ideal design combo, but spraying enough lead to make everyone duck for cover is the goal with the TMP. A top-mounted laser sight comes standard to make users think they’ll be aiming.

**HEAVY PISTOLS**
Pistols

Heavy pistols can take top- and barrel- mounted accessories.

**Ares Predator VI**

The Predator V rode on the laurels of its name. The Predator VI is genuine innovation built into some classic styling. Built on the framing of the original Predator, the VI comes with the standard smartgun operations but adds Burst Fire capability and a new variable ammunition system that will make it king of the streets and warzones once again, even if it comes with a price tag to match that innovation. The variable ammunition system allows a single specially designed magazine (30¥ per spare) to be loaded with different ammo types. The smartgun is used to select ammo types and cycles them to the chamber in whatever quantity is necessary and available. If there aren’t enough rounds of a particular kind, the ammo counter reads empty and the weapon stops firing.

**Ares Viper Slivergun**

The unique Slivergun hangs out in the Heavy Pistol class, but it’s a creature all its own. The Slivergun fires metal slivers that count as flechette ammunition and are bought as such, but they aren’t interchangeable with any other flechette weapon. The weapon remains capable of Burst Fire and has a silencer integrated into the barrel, and the large ammo capacity makes it a terror on the streets.

**Browning Ultra Power**

Once the Predator’s primary competition as the world’s best heavy pistol, the Ultra Power has ceded its claim to the title since it has not kept pace with the tech advances in the Pred-VI. The Browning is cheaper, though, and offers a built-in top-mounted laser sight.

**Colt Government 2076/Manhunter**

Governments need new weapons contracts for bribe purposes, so having a new standard issue after only ten years seems about par for the course. The years of technomancer and hacker fear since the ’60s have left the electronic firing 2066 in a lot of storage cabinets for fear of hacking. The 2076 takes a jump back to the style of the classic Manhunter (in fact, the model with an integrated smartgun system has that denotation) and comes with an integral laser sight.

**Ruger Super Warhawk**

Boom and glitz! That’s the standard street tag for the Super Warhawk. This revolver is shiny and chrome and makes holes the size of a troll’s fist straight out of the box. Upgrade the ammo or the features and those holes get real precise.

**SUBMACHINE GUNS**
Automatics 

SMGs can take top- and barrel-mounted accessories.

**Colt Cobra TZ Series**

Colt loves variety, and the Cobra TZ series highlights the options they offer with this line. The 100 is the base model with an integral folding stock, the 110 adds a top-mounted laser sight, the 120 features the folding stock, top-mounted laser sight, and a barrel-mounted gas-vent system, making it a hit with security forces all over the world and with trid shows that love all the fancy features.

**FN P93 Praetor**

An unmistakable bullpup design offers a builtin fear response from anyone who sees these guns in the hand of corpsec forces. The Praetor offers an integrated rigid stock, a laser sight, and a flashlight with three settings to benefit low-light, thermographic, or regular vision.

**HK-227**

Heckler & Koch know how to design an SMG, since the 227 has been built off the same frame (the venerable MP5) for over a century. A top choice for corporate and military security forces, the HK–227 offers a retractable stock, integrated smartgun system, and an integral barrel- mounted silencer.

**Ingram Smartgun XI**

Street samurai create legendary reputations that they don’t always deserve, but the Smartgun has maintained its street rep as a grade-A bang bang for decades. Famous as the weapon of choice for many legendary street samurai since the 2050s, the Ingram Smartgun comes tricked out with a gasvent system, a smartgun system, and an integral silencer.

**SCK Model 100**

Shin Chou Kyogo has made the Model 100 the corp-suit equivalent of the Smartgun with the help of the elite Red Samurai. Across the Japanacorps, their security forces are issued the SCK 100. The Model 100 features an internal smartgun system and a folding stock.

**Uzi V**

A new design for a new world. The latest model Uzi is a big market entry for Spinrad Global. The V model features an integral folding stock and builtin top-mounted laser sight.

**Shotguns**
Longarm

The stats for these shotguns are for normal slug rounds. Shotguns can take top, barrel, and underbarrel accessories.

**Defiance T-250**

A solid street howitzer, this semi-automatic shotgun is available in either a normal-length or short-barreled version. It is gas operated and features a secondary pump action for situations where preventing jams is more important than quickly firing a second shot (clear glitch jams with a Minor Action). The short-barreled version has a Concealability threshold of 3, DV 3, Attack Ratings 8/8/4/—/—.

**Mossberg CMDT**

This assault shotgun provides classic bang for the buck. It can either be loaded with ten-round ammo clips or a big boy twenty-four-round drum. The best features are burst fire mode and a top-mounted laser sight.

**PJSS Model 55**

Rich people own shotguns too. Small production runs, usually purchased by rich European hunters and trap shooters, make this a status symbol made for killing. The Model 55 comes with a rigid stock equipped with an integrated shock pad. Both barrels can be shot at once as a short burst (see Not Enough Rounds).

**Remington Roomsweeper**

Double-barreled and pistol gripped makes this little beast bad news when it slips out of a pocket. If you’re not a fan of flechette shooters, load some Heavy Pistol rounds into a Roomsweeper and she shoots like a really inaccurate hand cannon.

**ASSAULT RIFLES**
Automatics 

Rifles can take top, barrel-, and underbarrel-mounted accessories.

**AK-97**

The AK-97 will never go out of style, especially since it still looks like its mid-twentieth-century predecessor. Built for reliability and endurance, it’s not the prettiest girl at the dance, but it can sure shake a tailfeather.

**Ares Alpha**

Made famous in the hands of Ares Firewatch teams, the Alpha quickly became a worldwide success with UCAS and CAS special operators along with a myriad of Desert Wars teams. The integrated underbarrel grenade launcher, smartgun system, and an innovative design for superior handling make it special.

**Colt M23**

Cheap, mass-produced, and infinitely adaptable, the M23 finds its ways to the hands of everyone from gangbangers to pirates to delta-level government operators. The M23 can accept two additional underbarrel accessories for a total of three.

**FN HAR**

Fabrique Nationale is the name to fear when facing private security forces and corporate highthreat- response teams around the world. They made this weapon, which features a laser sight and a gas-vent system.

**Yamaha Raiden**

While Ares made the Alpha, the Japanacorps, through Yamaha, developed the Raiden. Electronic firing and exceptional accuracy are integral to the design. Japanacorp security forces and the Japanese Imperial Marines now swear by the Raiden. It features an integral silencer, smartgun system, and underbarrel shotgun/grenade launcher.

**Longarm Rifles**
Longarms

**Ares Desert Strike**

“The Desert Strike for the Desert Wars” is the tagline today. Built to fight in the harshest conditions, the Desert Strike comes equipped with a rigid stock with shock pad and a detachable imaging scope.

**Cavalier Arms Crockett EBR**

Cavalier played a dangerous game by offering a sniper rifle capable of burst fire. The Crockett EBR can stay accurate at long range, but those bursts don’t allow repeated accuracy. The Crockett comes standard with a rigid stock with shock pad and a detachable imaging scope.

**Remington 900**

A high-powered bolt-action hunting rifle with a classic wooden body. The base model is sold with a top-mounted imaging scope, but it cannot mount underbarrel accessories.

**Ruger 101**

Like futuretech in a hunting-rifle format, this gas-operated favorite sits in the hands of many professional hunters and hobbyists. It features a builtin imaging scope and a rigid stock with shock pad.

**Ranger Arms SM-6**

Ranger Arms knows what the SM line has always been about—silently neutralizing targets. This sniper rifle features a silencer, an imaging scope, a smartgun system, and a rigid stock with shock pad. The SM–6 carries on the line’s ability to quickly get into the action and then get out just as fast. It can fit into a standard briefcase; setting it up or breaking it down takes a Firearms + Intelligence (6, Major Action) Extended test. The SM-6 has dealt with the line’s fragility issues, and once put together it has no problem operating in any capacity.

**Barret Model 122**

Sometimes you need to shoot an enemy; sometimes you need to shoot an enemy through the side of an APC. The Barret Model 122 excels at tearing through metal and getting to the things it attempts to protect, ripping apart machines and vehicles with horrible tearing sounds that are music to the ears of the shooter. It has a silencer, smartgun system, and folding bipod.


**Machine Guns/Assault Cannons**
Heavy Weapons

Machine guns come in three categories—light, medium, and heavy—that determine their Attack Ratings. All, even the “light” ones, are bulky and unwieldy. A light machine gun is bigger and heavier than most rifles, while medium machine guns and heavy machine guns can only be carried by someone with Strength of 3+ and 5+, respectively, since they are designed as vehicle- mounted weapons. Machine guns can take top, barrel, and underbarrel accessories.

**Ingram Valiant**

The Valiant light machine gun sits in the hands of mercenary units the world over. Basic equipment includes a rigid stock with shock pad, a laser sight, and a barrel-mounted gas-vent system.

**Stoner-Ares M202**

This medium machine gun packs a tremendous punch and is often found in the hands of trolls with no concept of subtlety. It’s a brutally simple weapon, but accessorizing is always an option for those with a taste for more complexity.

**RPK HMG**

This heavy machine gun is used by militaries across eastern Europe and Asia. Usually set up as a vehicle-mounted weapon, it comes standard with a detachable tripod, as the RPK is best fired from a prone, sitting, or kneeling position when not mounted on a vehicle.

**Panther XXL**

Bulky, ugly, deadly, and as destructive as they come. Panther’s XXL model of assault cannon is the thing of nightmares on the street. To make sure every shot counts, it comes with a built-in smartgun system.

**SPECIAL WEAPONS**

Use the Exotic Ranged Weapon skill when firing these weapons.


**Ares S-III Super Squirt**

That name is terrible. Everyone thinks the Super Squirt is some kind of water gun, but it’s basically a glorified paintball marker that fires nonlethal dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) gel packs. The DMSO forces the skin to absorb whichever chemicals the operator wishes to deliver. The attack itself causes no damage, but when the target is hit successfully, the DMSO delivers the substance directly into the target’s bloodstream as a Contact-vector toxin (see Toxins and Drugs). The Super Squirt can accept top- and underbarrel- mounted accessories.

**Parashield DART Series**

Bringing down trolls with a little plastic, steel, and chemical cocktail for decades, Parashield sets the industry standard for dart weapons. The pistol model can accept top-mounted accessories only. The rifle includes a top-mounted imaging scope and can mount top and underbarrel accessories.

Wireless bonus: The dart reports whether or not it has struck home and successfully injected along with the effect based on heart rate and pulse levels, although its medical sensors are not very sophisticated (Device Rating of 1 for the dart).

**Launchers**

The Exotic Weapons skill is used to fire launchers, and they can take top and underbarrel accessories. Grenade launchers fire minigrenades, and missile launchers launch missiles or rockets.

**Ares Antioch II**

The Antioch II is the fanciest tube with a trigger around, complete with an integral smartgun system. A secondary trigger setting allows for wireless activation of launched projectiles. Wireless bonus: You can use the wireless link trigger for your grenades, even if you don’t have DNI.

**ArmTech MGL-6/MGL-12**

Semi-auto grenade launchers in a bullpup pistol and rifle style that can send a whole lot of bad news downrange real fast. 

Wireless bonus: When active the launcher will not detonate any ordnance loaded into the weapon within five yards of the weapon, even if a spoofed command tells it to do otherwise.

**Aztechnology Striker**

Deadly and disposable, the Striker is a great analogy for runners. The launch tube can be reused, which is nice considering recent price increases. Wireless bonus: Connecting this launcher to the local Matrix provides a +1 modifier bonus as long as no other bonus-applying systems are in use.

**Onotari Interceptor**

Saeder-Krupp developed this multipurpose missile launcher for military use. It has two separate barrels that can load two missiles at once, which don’t need to be the same type. Both barrels cannot be fired simultaneously, though this safety feature has been known to be removed, much to the dismay of the target—and the firer, as it turns out. It features an internal smartgun system that controls the fire-safety system. Firing both barrels launches both weapons. Split the attack modifier and resolve each projectile independently. The firer must resist 6P Fire damage when launching both tubes.

Wireless bonus: The safety system cannot be disengaged, but the firer gains the smartlink wireless bonus.



### Firearm Accessesories

Most firearm accessories must be attached to a particular mount—top, barrel, underbarrel. Each mount can only hold one accessory at a time.

**Airburst link**

A smartgun accessory for grenade and rocket launchers uses a rangefinder to air-burst the explosive projectile in close proximity to the target. An airburst link reduces the scatter distance for a launched weapon by two yards per net hit instead of one yard per hit (Blast Attacks and Scatter) when you use the wireless link trigger. The airburst link also prevents the defender from using the Hit the Dirt Action to reduce damage, as the Prone status offers no benefit against the airburst. 

Wireless bonus: An airburst link requires wireless functionality to function at all. Both the grenades and the launcher must have wireless mode turned on for the system to function.

**Bipod**

A two-legged brace extends down from the weapon, allowing it to be fired low to the ground with the user in a prone or sitting position. A bipod can be attached to the underbarrel mount of a weapon and provides a +2 to the Attack Rating when properly deployed. Attaching a bipod takes a Major Action. Folding up or deploying a bipod is a Minor Action.

Wireless bonus: The Attack Rating bonus increases to +3 if used when prone or sitting.

**Concealable holster**

A small holster worn just about anywhere on the body it can’t be seen, attached with a smart adhesive. It increases the Concealability threshold of the weapon inside by 1. Only pistols (including machine pistols) and tasers fit in a concealable holster.

Wireless bonus: Sensors, smart-fabric, and active adhesive allow the holster to alter color and move small amounts in real time, increasing the Concealability threshold by an additional 1.

**Gas-vent system**

Gas-vent recoil compensation systems are barrel-mounted accessories that vent a weapon’s barrel gases at a specific vector to counter muzzle climb. Once installed, a gas-vent cannot be removed. Gas-vent systems remove the Attack Rating penalty for Semi-Automatic fire and reduce it to 2 for Burst Fire.

**Gyro mount**

This heavy harness features an articulated and motorized gyro-stabilized arm. The mount can hold a rifle or machine gun. The system negates the Attack Rating adjustment for Semi-Auto and Burst Fire and provides a +3 Attack Rating for Full-Auto. This system also shifts the Strength requirements for medium and heavy machine guns to 2+ and 4+ respectively. Attaching or removing a weapon from the mount takes a Minor Action. Putting on a gyro-mount harness takes about a minute, while the quick-release allows you to get out of it with a Major Action. 

Wireless bonus: Activating the harness’s quick-release with a wireless signal to exit the harness is a Minor Action.

**Hidden arm slide**

Attached to the forearm and worn under clothing, this slide can fit a Hold-out, Light Pistol, or Taser. With a Minor Action and a specific movement, the slide moves the weapon into your hand. The use of a hidden arm slide provides a Bonus Effect when first used. It also increases the Concealability threshold by 1.

Wireless bonus: You get a bonus Minor Action on any turn when you activate the slide.

**Imaging scope**

The classic top-mounted scope that includes a micro camera and vision magnification, along with a Capacity of 3 for additional vision enhancements. Attachment or removal takes only a Minor Action. The Take Aim Minor Action must be used in order to gain the benefits of an imaging scope, though the modifier bonus from that action is not gained for the first action of use. When you are using an imaging scope, your target cannot gain Bonus Effect by having a higher Defense Rating. Wireless bonus: The scope’s “line of sight” can be shared, allowing you to share what your scope sees with your team (and yourself if you’re using it to look around a corner).

**Laser sight**

This device uses a laser beam to project a visible dot (normal, low-light, or thermographic) on the target. This increases the weapon’s Attack Rating by 1, not cumulative with smartlink modifiers. The laser sight can be mounted as either an underbarrel mount or top mount. Activating or deactivating a laser sight is a Minor Action.

Note that in weapons with a laser sight included as standard equipment, this bonus is already calculated into the Attack Rating.

Wireless bonus: The bonus to the Attack Rating increases to 2. You gain a bonus Minor Action on a turn when you activate or deactivate the laser sight.

**Periscope**

This adjustable viewer attaches to a top mount and allows the user to target a weapon around corcorners, reducing the Cover IV modifier penalty to –1 when using the Take Cover Action. A periscope can be upgraded with any of the vision enhancements noted on. Capacity 3. Wireless bonus: The modifier penalty noted above is reduced to 0.

**Quick-draw holster**

An easy access holster designed to hold pistols and tasers. Use of the Quick-Draw holster provides a bonus Minor Action when the Quick-Draw Action is taken.

**Shock pads**

A shock-absorbing pad situated on the rigid stock of a rifle, shotgun, or heavy weapon. It decreases the Semi-Auto and Burst Fire Attack Rating modifiers by 1.

**Silencer**

A barrel-mounted accessory for reducing the sound and flash of firing a weapon; not compatible with revolvers or shotguns. It increases the threshold on Perception tests by 2 to notice the weapon’s use or locate the weapon’s firer. Attaching or removing a silencer takes a Major Action.

Wireless bonus: The silencer features systems and simple software that alerts you via AR if someone nearby moves quickly in response to the sound of the silenced weapon.

**Smart firing platform**

A robotic tripod equipped with a mechanized pivot that allows for a 180-degree firing arc and a 60-degree inclination. It can mount one smartgun- equipped weapon to the platform. The weapon will be fired by the platform’s onboard pilot (Device Rating 3), using a pre-programmed Targeting Autosoft (Rating 3). It can be upgraded with additional autosofts, usually a Clearsight program. You need to set the parameters of who exactly the platform should and shouldn’t shoot at, which are followed by the platform’s pilot. The platform negates the Attack Rating adjustments for Semi-Auto and Burst Fire and offers a +3 Attack Rating for Full-Auto. It has an Initiative rank of Pilot x 4, Ability Dice Code Initiative Dice, 4 Minor Actions, and 1 Major Action. Wireless bonus: You can fire the mounted weapon remotely using an implanted smartlink using VR, replacing the system’s dice pools with your own.

**Smartgun system**

This is the firearm or a projectile-weapon side of the smartlink system. The system includes a small camera and range finder. It keeps track of ammunition and, through DNI, allows switching between gun modes, ejecting a clip, and firing the gun without pulling the trigger. The camera allows you to fire from cover, suffering no Attack test penalties while affected by the Cover Status. If you’re using a smartlink, the smartgun system increases the gun’s Attack Rating by 2 across all available range categories. The smartgun features are accessed either by universal access port cable to an imaging device (like glasses, goggles, or a datajack for someone with cybereyes) or by a wireless connection working in concert with direct neural interface. Internal smartgun systems add 500 nuyen to the weapon price. An external smartgun system can be attached to the top mount or underbarrel mount with an Engineering + Intelligence (4, 1 hour) Extended Test. The small camera has a capacity of 1 and can be equipped with vision enhancements.

**Spare clip**

This is an unloaded standard magazine for a specific selected weapon. Wireless bonus: The clip provides a current ammo count even without a smartgun system.

**Speed loader**

The speed loader holds a ring of bullets for reloading a revolver’s cylinder. Speed loaders are specific to the weapon. It lets you fully reload a revolver as a Minor Action.

**Tripod**

The tripod provides a stable base to fire a weapon low to the ground with the user kneeling or sitting. A tripod can be attached to the underbarrel mount. It negates the Attack Rating adjustments for Semi-Auto and Burst Fire and offers a +3 Attack Rating for Full-Auto when properly deployed. Attaching a tripod takes a Major Action. Folding up or deploying the bipod is a Minor Action. Wireless bonus: The player gains a free Minor Action on a turn when they fold up, deploy, or remove the tripod.


### Ammunition

Ammunition is defined by type (regular, gel, APDS, etc.), class of firearm (light pistol, heavy pistol, assault rifle, etc.) and is considered cased unless the caseless option is purchased. Unless indicated otherwise in its description, a gun can fire cased or caseless ammo, but not both. Each class of gun can trade ammo with another of its class. For example, all Heavy Pistols and SMGs can share ammo. An ammunition type’s Attack Rating Modifier and Damage Value Modifier are added to the weapon’s ratings. For example, an Ares Predator VI (DV 3P, Attack Ratings Close 9, Near 9, Medium 7, Far —, Extreme —) loaded with explosive rounds (AR —, DV +1) has a DV of 4P with no change to the Attack Ratings.

**Caseless vs. Cased**

Caseless ammo is rare these days, with the corps wanting to track who’s doing what against them. With no shell casing it’s one less thing to help track down a culprit. They also install a hardened stealth micro-RFID in half of all the cased rounds they produce that activates when fired and alerts local authorities. Most runners have a tech guy who waves his magic wand (tag eraser) over their ammo and fries the tags, but it doesn’t always work, and not everyone owns a tag eraser.

Erasing tags requires a tag eraser. Make an Electronics + Intelligence (2, 1 minute) for every ten rounds being erased.


| **AMMO, PER 10 SHOTS** | **DAMAGE MODIFIER** | **AP MODIFIER** | **AVAILABILITY** | **COST** |

**APDS**

Armor-piercing discarding sabot is a mouthful, which is why the APDS acronym is used so frequently. The sabot allows for high muzzle velocities pushing an ultra-hard penetrator designed to punch through armor. APDS is rarely made caseless because the sabot shells are left lying around anyway.

**Explosive**

These slugs carry a shaped-charge explosive. Explosive rounds misfire whenever you roll a critical glitch. When this happens, the attacker must resist damage equal to the Damage Value done by the weapon (and don’t forget the modifier for the explosive rounds). Naturally, the attack misses its
intended target, and the weapon firing the bullets is destroyed.

**Flechette**

The payload of a flechette (fl) round is made up of tiny, tightly packed fin-stabilized metal slivers or metal balls (depending on the weapon). They have some spread, making them more likely to catch a soft spot, but they’re small compared to other ammo, delivering less kinetic energy to the target.

**Gel**

These gel-ball rounds look like flattened blueberries on impact. Generally used for riot control or non-lethal subdual, they’re great for knocking a target on their hoop, though you shouldn’t expect that to work on trolls. Gel rounds inflict Stun damage. A target struck by a gel round must succeed at an immediate Quickness (2) or Body (4) test (player’s choice) or gain the Prone status. Burst Fire and Full Auto increase the threshold to avoid being knocked down by 1.

**Stick-n-Shock**

Stick-n-Shock rounds make any regular weapon a taser. They deal Stun damage and apply the Zapped status but don’t carry the punch of the regular round.

**Assault cannon**

Big rounds for assault cannons. They’re the only thing assault cannons can load, and they can’t be modified with other types.

**Injection darts**

Each injection dart carries a single dose of a drug or toxin (purchased separately). Successful delivery of the payload requires at least one net hit on the Attack test versus an unarmored target or two net hits against a target with any form of armor, be it worn or natural. The effect of the dart depends on the drug payload and is an Injection-vector toxin attack

**Taser**

These darts are designed to be loaded into taser weapons.

**Regular**

Classic ball or full metal jacket slugs.


**All Things That Go BOOM!**

Some days, you want to make things blow up real good. Okay, make that most days. Anyway, here are some ways to blow a little select portion of the world to smithereens.

**Grenades**

Grenades are small, self-contained explosive packages. Boom and shrapnel all in one neat and deadly little cluster! Minigrenades are specifically designed for use with grenade launchers, set to arm when they have traveled five yards and explode on impact or with an airburst link. The five-yard safety feature can be disabled with an `Engineering + Intelligence (4, 5 Minutes) Extended Test`. Minigrenades have the same effects as standard grenades.

The damage from grenades becomes less the farther away from them you are. The DV entry for grenades lists the initial damage for those closest to the grenade, within a yard, called Ground Zero, then two categories of lesser damage for those in Close and Near Range, with the damage limited to a maximum range of the Blast attribute. Use the `Athletics skill + Quickness` when throwing grenades, or `Exotic Weapons (Launcher) + Quickness` when launching a grenade from a grenade launcher. Follow the rules for Blast Attacks. Grenades and similar explosives can also be rigged with a tripwire to be set up as a basic booby trap. This requires an `Engineering + Intelligence (8, 1 Major Action) Extended Test`. All grenades have the following wireless feature: You can use the wireless link trigger for your grenades via an ARO on your commlink even if you don’t have direct neural interface.

**Stun grenade**

Often called flash-bangs, these grenades explode to create a bright, loud, shocking blast that stuns and staggers anyone in their range. Along with the damage, those in the Blast of a Stun grenade suffer the Blinded I, Deafened I, and Dazed Status Effect.

**Flash-pak**

This is an electronic box, ten centimeters by ten centimeters on its face and two centimeters thick, containing a set of micro-flashes on each side designed to fire in random strobing sequence to confuse opponents. Anyone in the range of a flash-pak and using standard vision receives the Blinded status (p. 51) indicated in the DV chart on all tests that include vision due to the strobe effect. Using low-light causes the status to shift up one level. Flare compensation drops the status down one level. The flash-pak has ten charges and uses one charge per combat round. Plugged in, it recharges one charge every ten seconds. 

Wireless bonus: The strobe sequence can avoid directing strong flashes at the subscribed character preventing any Status Effect for them. The device can recharge by induction, regaining one charge per hour

**Fragmentation**

The classic grenade, designed to launch deadly shrapnel over a large area.

**High explosive**

These grenades are designed to deliver a powerful blast but over a smaller space.

**Gas**

Any chemical or toxin payload can be chosen (Toxins and Drugs). The cloud lasts for approximately 10 combat rounds, based on the Gas Attack rules.

**Smoke/thermal smoke**

Similar to the gas grenade, a smoke grenade releases a cloud of smoke instead of toxic gas. The cloud obscures vision, inflicting the Blinded I Status for anyone acting through the smoke and Blinded II for anyone trying to act from within the smoke. The cloud lasts for approximately 10 combat rounds based on the Gas Attack rules.

| Missile Variant            | as Rocket | as Rocket    | as Rocket   | as Rocket | +1(I)     | As Rocket + Sensor rating x 500¥ | +2 to Attack Rating  |

Rockets are launched projectiles with stabilizing fins, a propulsion system, and a warhead. Missiles are rockets that carry internal guidance systems, with sensor packages adding their rating to the attack roll, since they can adjust their trajectory in flight (also reflected in their Attack Rating). Rockets and missiles are set to arm when they have traveled 10 yards from their point of origin and explode on impact or with an airburst link. This safety feature can be disabled with an `Engineering + Intelligence (4, 5 Minutes) Extended Test`.

As is the case with grenades, damage from rockets and missiles decreases the farther you are from the point of impact. The ranges differ based on the weapon, as listed in the stats for each weapon. All rockets and missiles have the following wireless feature: You can use the wireless link trigger for your rocket or missile, even if you don’t have a direct neural interface.

**Anti-vehicle**

AV rockets/missiles contain a shaped-charge warhead designed to burn or punch its way through a vehicle or barrier. Though the impact causes a blast, it is limited compared to that of a High-Explosive projectile. +2 Attack Rating against vehicles.

**Fragmentation** 

Used principally against people, the warhead discharges high-speed fragments designed to tear soft targets. These rockets/missiles are very effective against unprotected individuals, but not great against barriers, structures, and vehicles.

**High explosive** 

HE rockets/missiles are designed to do heavy
damage to a small area. Their blast pattern is similar
to that of a grenade, but slightly larger.


**Conventional Explosives**

| Explosives Rating | AVAIL | COST            |

| Detonator Cap     | 4(I)  | 75¥             |



Explosives are primarily used to damage structures, but metahumankind has come up with many ways to have them hurt body structures. You can use the Engineering skill to prepare explosives

A range of explosive compounds, both solid and liquid, are available to the construction industry for all their destructive needs. All explosives are bought as an Explosive Package with a set Rating that encompasses an amalgamation of their power and quantity without defining either. They cannot be combined between rating ranges due to the differences in compounds and quantities. This makes using them simpler

**Plastic**

These highly stable, moldable, and adhesive explosive compounds are military grade. They’re ideal for certain jobs, like breaching walls and are usually color-tinted to indicate the level of current needed to detonate them, from the black of magnetic- field induction to the chalky white of 440- volt industrial explosives. We say usually because some bomb makers like to dye their devices to throw off bomb techs trying to disarm their device.

**Foam**

Plastic explosives with the consistency of shaving cream, stored in an aerosol can. Perfect for spraying into crevices, and detonated the same way as regular plastic explosives.

**Detonator cap**

This detonator is inserted into a mass of explosives and set off either by a programmable timer or radio signal. Setting the timer takes a Major Action. Wireless bonus: You can set the detonator’s timer with a Minor Action. You gain a Minor Action Command DNI-linked device Action to detonate the explosive.

### Clothing and Armor

The streets of 2080 are mean, but so is the air, the rain, the paracritters, and a plethora of other things that can kill you just for walking out your front door. What’s the solution? Armor! Get yours here, and maybe you’ll survive a few days in the sprawl.

**Clothing**

Clothing in 2080 has some serious functionality options: commlinks, music players, and other electronic devices can be woven right in, powered by interwoven batteries or special energy-gathering fabrics. On the other side of the economy, cheap soybased “flats” can be had for ten nuyen a set from vending machines around whatever sprawl you find yourself in. Spend more money, look more chic—simple as that.

#### Clothing Descriptions

**Electrochromic feature**

Electrochromic threads can change color with voltage, letting you alter the color of your clothing or display text, images, or patterns. This is good for fashion, but great for vanishing into a crowd if you need a quick costume change. You can even get armored clothing in electrochromic styles. It takes a Minor Action to change the settings on your electrochromic clothes, but two combat rounds to complete the change.

Wireless bonus: You gain a free Minor Action during any turn when you change your clothes’ settings, and your clothing can display images, text files, or video from your commlink.

**Feedback feature**

This haptic clothing allows for a tactile component to an augmented reality experience.

#### Armor Descriptions

Due to materials advances modern armor can be lightweight, flexible, and concealable. Armor adds to Defense Rating, and multiple items do not stack unless noted.

**Leather jacket/duster**

Synthleather is the norm for street types, and this type of jacket (waist-length to duster) never goes out of style. It even offers a modicum of protection.

**Actioneer business clothes**

This is the fancy armored suit popular among Mr. Johnsons, faces, and fixers looking for a little protection coupled with style. It features a concealable holster in the jacket.

**Armor clothing**

Lightweight ballistic weave makes these garments almost impossible to detect as armor. It doesn’t provide as much protection as real armor, but it comes in just about any style you desire.

**Armor jacket**

Available in all manner of styles, it offers good protection without catching too much attention. But don’t think of wearing one to a social event or government building.

**Armor vest**

A flexible-wrap vest designed to be worn under regular clothing without displaying any bulk.

**Chameleon suit**

A head-to-toe suit with a ruthenium polymer coating supported by a sensor suite, allowing it to scan its surroundings and replicate the images at the proper perspectives. You gain a bonus Edge when performing Stealth tests to hide while wearing an active suit.

Wireless bonus: The suit also raises your Defense Rating by 2 thanks to improved hiding ability.

**Full body armor**

This armor is worn by military and security personnel around the world for heavy-duty jobs. It is styled for intimidation but includes an array of tactical holsters, pouches, and webbing for deadly efficiency. It’s going to draw attention, just so you know. The suit can be modified for environmental adaptation (hot or cold environments) or chemically sealed to completely protect the wearer from toxic environments and attacks. The suit comes with a helmet with a Capacity of 6 for vision or audio enhancements.

**Lined coat**

This cowboy-style duster has been consistently popular on the mean streets of the world’s sprawls for the past fifty years. Besides being protective, the armored trenchcoat provides a bonus Edge against tests to spot items hidden underneath.

**Urban Explorer jumpsuit**

Designed for couriers, athletes, and freerunners, this is the armored version of “flats” but available in a stupid array of styles. Because they’re so hip, these jumpsuits include a built-in music player and biomonitor.


##### ARMOR MODIFICATIONS

Armor can be upgraded with a range of modifications. The Capacity of a piece of armor is listed in the Armor Table. Armor modifications have a Capacity costs equal to their rating; the Capacity cost determines how much you can stuff into a single piece of armor.

**Chemical Protection**

This modification protects the wearer against Contact-vector chemical attacks (Toxins and Drugs, p. 121). The special coating neutralizes the Corrosive status for a number of attacks equal to its rating.

**Chemical Seal**

Available only with full body armor, the chemical seal is an airtight environmental control that takes a Major Action to activate. It prevents the effects of all statuses connected to Contact- and Inhalation- vector chemicals but can only be used for a total of an hour at a time due to the air supply. It also neutralizes the Corrosive status six times before it’s built in chemical protection is worn away and the armor no longer has chemical seal protection. Wireless bonus: Activating the chemical seal is a Minor Action.

**Cold Resistance**

Thermal fibers and heat-retentive materials protect the wearer. The armor cancels the Chilled status a number of times equal to its rating. Once it has resisted the Chilled status a number of times equal to its rating, it is worn away, and the armor no longer has cold resistance.

**Fire Resistance**

Fire-retardant, nonflammable materials protect the wearer. The armor cancels the Burning status a number of times equal to its rating. Past that point, it is worn away, and the armor no longer has fire resistance.

**Electricity Resistance**

Electrical insulation and non-conductive materials protect the wearer. The armor cancels the Zapped status a number of times equal to its rating. Once it has been Zapped a number of times equal to its rating, it is worn away, and the armor no longer has electricity resistance.

#### Helmets & Shields

Helmets come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes and protect your noggin from trauma. Helmets have Capacity that is usable for accessories such as trode nets and vision enhancements.

**Shields**

**Ballistic shield**

The impressive black shield used by SWAT teams and in urban combat. It features a clear plasteel window and a built-in ladder frame along the inside so that it can be used to climb over short obstacles.

**Riot shield**

The clear plasteel cousin of the ballistic shield, this one adds an electricity attack option. Use the Close Combat skill for the attack and attack characteristics of a Stun Baton. The taser shield holds 10 charges; when attached to a power point, it regains one charge per 10 seconds.

Wireless bonus: The riot shield recharges by induction, recharging one charge per hour.

### ELECTRONICS

#### COMMLINKS

Commlinks are universal communication devices used by virtually everyone all the time. They come in a variety of shapes and styles, with some included in augmentations and articles of clothing. Even the most basic of them include AR Matrix browsing capability, telephone, vidphone, text, music players, micro trid-projectors, touchscreen displays, high-resolution video and still-image cameras, image/text and RFID tag scanners, builtin GPS guidance systems, chip players, credstick readers, retractable earbuds, voice access, and textto- speech and speech-to-text technologies. They also offer plenty of other add-on features.

### Cyberdecks

When the corps cracked down on the Matrix, working hard to prevent illicit use of their pretty new system, the cyberdeck re-emerged as the tool for messing with innards of the Matrix. They are powerful devices in the hands of a skilled decker. The newest models look something like medieval bracers, only less bulky. They’re worn on the wrist and can project keyboards (or whatever interface the user prefers) onto the user’s arm, a nearby surface, or just the air around them. Some models have screens; most don’t. They tend to look like a block with a series of ports, though many deckers connect to their deck wirelessly. For more information about them, see Devices. All cyberdecks include hot-sim modules.

Cyberjacks are a fairly invasive piece of gear, implanted deep into the brain, and meant to interface more smoothly with a cyberdeck. While they can act as a simple datajack, they also perform the function of integrating the ASIST interface more directly, thus providing superior speed and response times.

They represent the Data Processing and Firewall attributes

Combat Step By Step

1. Determine Surprise
2. Establish Positions
3. Determine Initiative
4. Take Turns
5. Move to next Round

### Surprise

A band of runners sneaks up on a a group of guards. A hell hound sneaks down an officer hallway, unnoticed by the runners until the hell hound engulfs one of them in flame. In these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other.

The GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the GM compares the Quickness  (Sneaking) tests of anyone hiding with the passive Intuition (Perception) [`10 + Intuition`] score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or critter that doesn’t notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.

If you’re surprised, you can’t move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can’t take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren’t.

### Initiative

Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When com⁠bat starts, every participant makes a Initiative Test `Ability Dice Code + (Reaction + Intution) + Initiative Die` for personal combat, other types of combat have different Initiative Tests on the table below, to determine their place in the initiative order. The GM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time.

The GM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This is the order (called the initiative order) in which they act during each round. The initiative order remains the same from round to round.

If a tie occurs, the DM decides the order among tied DM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters. The GM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character. Optionally, the GM can have the tied characters and monsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first; or have them go simultaneously.

**Initiative Table**

| Initiative Type | Initiative Test                         |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Personal Combat | (Reaction + Intuition) + Initiative Die |
| Astral Combat   | Inuition x 2 + Initiative Die           |



#### Timed Items & Initiative

Unless the item allows a timer to be set, in which case the player can determine when, these items go off at the end of the players turn.

### Movement and Position

In combat, characters and NPC's are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand.

On your turn if you use a Dash you can use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following the rules here.

Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can constitute your entire move. However you're moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.

#### Breaking Up Your Move

You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your another action. For example, if you have a speed of 10 yards, you can move 2 yards, take your action, and then move 8 yards.

#### Difficult Terrain

Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains.

Furniture-strewn offices, rubble filled streets, treacherous staircases—the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.

Every yard of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra yard. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.

Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.

#### Being Prone

Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are prone, a condition described in the appendix.

You can drop prone without using any of your speed. Standing up takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to one third your speed. For example, if your speed is 10 yards, you must spend 3 yards of movement to stand up. You can't stand up if you don't have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.

To move while prone, you must crawl or use magic. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra yard. Crawling 1 yard in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 yards of movement.

#### Moving around Other Creatures

You can move through a nonhostile creature's space. In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature's space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature's space is difficult terrain for you.

Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can't willingly end your move in its space.

If you leave a hostile creature's reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained later in the chapter.


### Action In Combat

The Action economy of Sixfinity is mare structured than the economy in Shadowrun. 

When the action picks up and the game moves into taking turns in initiative order, it’s good to know how much time is passing and what you can do in that time.

When you get to take a turn and describe what your character is doing, your actions are contained in a combat round. A combat round lasts for about three seconds of in-universe time. Everyone, player characters and non-player characters alike, take a single player turn within that round.

Each combat round, you gain an action allotment that you use on your player turn. Actions come in two categories: Minor and Major. The basic action allotment for each character is 1 Minor Action and 1 Major Action per combat round. Players get 1 additional Minor Action for every Initiative Die they have. Players can trade Minor and Major Actions, using a Major Action to perform a Minor Action or using 4 Minor Actions to perform a Major Action (possibly providing an extra attack in a single player turn). Each action has a note next to it indicating when it can be performed; this is either Initiative (I) or Anytime (A). Initiative Actions can only be performed on the character’s player turn during an initiative round, while Anytime Actions can be used at any time. Note, though, that in order to perform an Anytime Action, you must have an Action left. If you spent them all on your turn, you can’t use one later. So sometimes it pays to save an action for later in the round if you act early. Note that actions cannot be carried from one round to another unless that is specifically allowed in a rule.

Along with these actions, enough words can be spoken or conversation can be shared to fill three seconds; if there is any doubt about the amount of words that can be said, time it!

Every **combat round** a character gets:
- 1 Major Action and 1 Minor Actions



#### Minor Actions
These actions usually take only a small amount of focus or a quick and simple thought or movement. A key point among Minor Actions is that they generally do not require a test of any kind. That doesn’t mean in truly dire situations where the pressure is on that the gamemaster can’t ask for a test to be made—it just means that usually, as long as you have the action available, you can perform the task by simply declaring the use of it.

| Minor Actions                 |
| ----------------------------- |
| Activate/Deactivate Focus (I) |

| Stand Up (I)                  |
| Take Cover  (I)               |
| Trip (I)                      |

##### Activate (Deactivate) Focus (I)

A character can activate or deactivate a bonded focus that they are carrying on their person with a Minor Action.

##### Attack of Opportunity (A)

When an enemy leaves your threatened area you may make an immediate melee attack on them as long as you have a Minor Action available to you.

##### Block (A)

A character can add their Close Combat skill to their Defense versus Melee Attacks. This lasts until they are attacked or their next turn

##### Change Device Mode (A)

A character may use a Minor Action to activate, deactivate, or switch the mode on any device that they are linked to by a direct neural interface, be it a wired or wireless link. This includes activating or deactivating cyberware, changing a smartgun’s firing settings, switching a commlink to hidden mode, turning a device’s wireless functionality off, and so on

##### Command Drone (I)

A character may issue a command to a drone they control. If multiple drones are controlled through a rigger command console (RCC), the same command can be issued to every drone. If a different command is desired for each drone, it requires multiple Minor Actions.

##### Command Spirit (I)

A character may issue a service command to a single spirit or group of spirits under their control, or dismiss them. The service must be the same. If multiple services are desired, multiple Minor Actions must be used.

##### Dismiss Spirit (A)

A character may dismiss their spirit at any time with a Minor Action.

##### Dodge (A)

A character can add their Athletics skill to their Defense versus Ranged Attacks. This lasts until they are attacked or their next turn.

##### Drop Object (A)

A character may drop an object they are holding in their hand or hands as a single Minor Action. The objects fall to the ground and may suffer damage or ill effects if the gamemaster so chooses, depending on the distance of the fall and the landing spot.

##### Drop Prone (I)

A character may choose to drop themselves to the ground as a Minor Action. They gain the Prone status until they choose to use the Stand Up Action.

##### Move (I)

A character can use this Minor Action for 10 yards of movement. Only one Move Action is allowed per player turn.

##### Multiple Attacks (I)

A character can attack more than one opponent, assuming ammunition, reach, and enemy placement allow it. Split your modifier evenly among all targets rounded down. This action must be used in conjunction with an Attack Major Action.

##### Quick Draw (I)
A character may quick draw a pistol, pistol- sized weapon, or small throwing weapon and immediately attack with this Minor Action. The Attack action must be used in conjunction with this action. They must have the appropriate gear, augmentation, or quality to be allowed this action— if they don’t have something that allows this action, they can’t take it.

##### Reload Smartgun (I)

A character linked to a ready smartgun may use a mental command to eject the weapon’s clip while sliding a new one in with one deft motion, assuming that the new ammo is readily available.

##### Shift Perception (I)

A character capable of Astral Perception may shift perception to or from astral space as a Minor Action

##### Stand Up (I)

Whether they chose to be prone or they got knocked down, a character uses this action to get back to their feet and remove the Prone status

##### Take Aim (I)

A character gains a +1 bonus edge bonus with the use of this action. The action can only be taken once per combat round, but if the bonus is not used, it carries over to the next combat round, allowing it to be combined with actions taken over the course of several combat rounds. If the character takes a player turn without taking the Take Aim or Attack actions, any carryover bonuses from previous rounds are lost. The maximum bonus edge from the use of this action is equal to the character’s Willpower. A character may take aim with a ready firearm, bow, or exotic ranged weapon.

If the character is using vision magnification or a targeting scope, the Take Aim action must be used to line up the shot in order to receive any bonus from the item. In this case, the first action of Take Aim does not provide any additional bonus beyond enabling the function of the modification.

##### Take Cover (I)

The character uses something in their area to provide protection, but they also must operate from the constraints created by the cover. Taking cover gives the player the Cover I, II, III, or IV status

#### Major Actions

These actions take a bit more concentration or time to complete. Several involve a test of some kind, but some simply occur as long as you have the Action available. Just like Minor Actions, if there is no test involved but the gamemaster feels the pressure is on and one should be required, they have final say in the matter.

| Major Actions               |
| --------------------------- |
| Assist (A)                  |
| Astral Projection (I)       |
| Attack (I)                  |
| Banish Spirit (I)           |
| Cast Spell (I)              |
| Cleanse (I)                 |
| Counterspell (I)            |
| Full Defense (I)            |
| Manifest (I)                |
| Observe in Detail (I)       |
| Pick Up/Put Down Object (I) |
| Ready Weapon (I)            |
| Reload Weapon (I)           |
| Rigger Jump In (I)          |
| Sprint (I)                  |
| Summon Spirit (I)           |
| Use Simple Device (I)       |
| Use Skill (I)               |

##### Assist (A)
You make the same test they are making; your Effect becomes Bonus Effect for them to use up to 7 points total from your roll.

##### Astral Projection (I)

A character capable of Astral Projection (full magician or aspected magician) may shift their consciousness to or from the astral plane as a Major Action. The process is complete the moment the action is declared and therefore places them on the astral plane immediately, including for the remainder of the current combat round.

##### Attack (I)

A character may perform one of a variety of forms of attack with this Major Action. See the below for more details.

##### Banish Spirit (I)

Any character may attempt a Banishing on a spirit as a Major Action

##### Cast Spell (I)

A character may cast a spell as a Major Action. For details on how, see Spells

##### Cleanse (I)

Awakened characters use this action to erase traces of their magic activity

##### Counterspell (A)

Perform Counterspell (see Magic)

##### Full Defense (A)

A character can add their Willpower to all Defense tests until their next turn. It persists through attacks until their next turn.

##### Manifest (I)

Characters who are astrally projecting use this action to appear as a ghostly form

##### Observe in Detail (I)

A character may make a detailed observation by taking a Major Action. This action allows a Perception test or Assensing test. This action is intended for determining details that may be obscured due to the pace and rigors of combat. It is assumed that everyone engaged in a combat is aware of the presence of everyone else, barring the use of Stealth or obscuring magic, but not necessarily details of their gear or equipment, and in some particularly hectic or rushed circumstances, the identity of individuals. In the midst of a hectic gunfight/ brawl in the dark, the winner of the brawl, who is now sprinting toward your character, may not be identifiable without an Observe in Detail action. (Deprecated)

##### Pick Up/Put Down Object (I)

A character may pick up an object within reach or put down one that they were holding as a Major Action. This action means care is taken to put the object down or pick it up. If the picked-up object is a weapon, this counts as readying the weapon.

##### Ready Weapon (I)

A character may ready a weapon by using this action. This includes drawing and readying a firearm; pulling a melee weapon from a sheath or pocket; taking out and readying a grenade or throwing knife; or any other kind of weapon preparation. Almost all weapons require this action before they are ready for use, though many times it occurs before combat even starts. Small weapons such as throwing knives and shuriken can be readied in bunches, with a total number equal to the character’s Quickness attribute pulled into the character’s off-hand with a single Ready Weapon action.

##### Reload Weapon (I)

Weapons without a smartlink, or weapons where the smartlink is currently disengaged, require a Major Action to reload. Reloading a weapon refills the weapon to its maximum capacity as long as the character has sufficient ammunition to do so.

##### Rigger Jump In (I)

A character with a vehicle control rig (VCR) and rigger-adapted vehicle or drone or a rigger command console (RCC) may jump in to control the vehicle or operate the RCC with a Major Action.

##### Sprint (I)

A character may move at a Sprint with this Major Action. Movement starts at 15 yards and is increased by 1 yard per effect on an `Athletics + Quickness Test (1)`. Only one Sprint Action is allowed per player turn, and it cannot be performed in the same turn as a Move action or Avoid Incoming action.

##### Summon Spirit (I)

A character capable of summoning may use a Major Action to summon a spirit to assist them. A spirit that is already summoned is controlled using the Command Spirit Minor Action.

##### Use Simple Device (I)

A character can use any simple device with a Major Action. Simple devices are those that are activated with a simple movement like a thumb trigger, pressing a single key, or tapping a single icon. It takes longer to interact with more complex devices, with required time being up to the gamemaster or listed with the description of specific gear. Remember, a device connected via a DNI-enabled system uses the Minor Action.

##### Use Skill (I)

A character may use an appropriate skill by using a Major Action



### Combat Round

A combat round is approximately 3 seconds long in the game world. During a single combat round, each participant gets an allotment of Actions to use on or around their player turn. The basic Action allotment for each character is 1 Minor Action and 1 Major Action per combat round. Players get 1 additional Minor Action for every Initiative Die they have.

Actions can be traded between Minor and Major, but there are restrictions. A Major Action can be used to perform a Minor Action, simple as that. A character can also trade 4 Minor Actions to perform 1 Major Action.

Characters may never start a player turn with more than 5 Minor Actions. If they would have earned more through any circumstances, that number is reduced to 5.

#### Attacks

Ranged Attack Rolls are rolled as: `Ability Dice Code + Firearms + Quickness + Misc` vs. Targets Defense Roll.




### Damage

Involved as they are in an illegal and often hazardous line of work, runners get hurt and get hurt often. What kind of damage, how bad an injury is, and how much it affects the character vary greatly depending on the situation.

Damage is calculated based on the weapon, spell, effect in Physical or Stun. You deduct that from your Health. 



#### Types of Injury

Damage in Sixfinity is defined as Physical or Stun. Each type of damage is tracked on a separate Condition Monitor.

##### Physical Damage

Physical damage, the most dangerous type, is the kind done by guns, explosions, most melee weapons, and many magic spells. Weapons that inflict Physical damage have the letter “P” following their Damage Value. Physical damage takes a longer time to heal.

##### Stun Damage

Stun damage—bruising, muscle fatigue, and the like— is the kind done by fists, kicks, blunt weapons, stun rounds, shock weapons, concussion grenades, and some magic spells. If something does Stun damage, the letter “S” follows the Damage Value. Stun damage takes a shorter time to heal.

### Healing

We’ve explained to you how to put the hurt on, so now let’s talk about getting the hurt off. Healing in Shadowrun is a mix of in-the-field first aid, miraculous magic, futuristic tech, and heroic speeds of natural recovery. Getting back in the fight is a lot more fun than lying in a hospital bed for weeks or months.

The first thing to cover is the order of operations for healing. Do you need to apply first aid before magic or after? Can you magically heal someone who’s already been treated by a medkit? The answer is simple: The order doesn’t matter, except that Overflow damage heals first. Every character gets multiple chances to get patched up before they’re stuck carrying around their injuries for days. The key here is how soon each needs to be applied. Details are under each description below.

#### First Aid
- Biotech + Intelligence (5 - Essence)

As implied by the name, this is probably the first aid you should apply because it has the narrowest window. After the end of a combat encounter in which a character was injured, they have 1 minute (20 combat rounds if another fight kicks off) to receive First Aid. To apply First Aid, a character needs the right tools for the job, in this case a first aid kit. Any test made without a kit suffers a -2 modifier, and no Edge can be spent on the test.

Make a `Biotech + Intelligence test against a threshold equal to 5 – target’s Essence`. If the target is one-hundred-percent natural, the healer actually gets an automatic +1 Effect added to what they roll. This represents the difficulty of repairing someone who has metal parts as well as those with organs not normally found in average people. Effect is used to heal 4 points of Stun Damage (**not including drain**) per effect or 4 points of Physical Damage or 2 points of Overflow per effect. Drain cannot be healed with First Aid. A character can receive First Aid only once for any single set of injuries.

#### Medkit
- Biotech + Intelligence (5 - Essence)

Medkits are more detailed. The patient must be connected to medkit monitors and diagnosed, after which they receive injections and IVs. After the end of a combat encounter in which a character is injured, they have one hour to be connected to a medkit or get medical attention from a trained professional with a medkit. If they wait beyond this period, a medkit will not help them. It takes one minute to hook up the patient, get the medkit to spit out a diagnosis, and begin treatment. The healing process takes one minute per 4 points healed (so, if the process is interrupted, you know how much they were patched up). Each time a medkit is used, it consumes one batch of supplies. Treatment cannot be attempted if no medkit supplies remain.

Make a `Biotech/Medkit Rating + Intelligence test against a threshold of 5 – target’s Essence`. If the target is one-hundred-percent natural, the healer gets an automatic +1 Effect added to their roll. Like First Aid, this fixes biological material, not machinery. Effect is used to heal 4 points of Stun, Physical, or Overflow Damage per Effect, but not damage from drain.

There is a limit to receiving a medkit treatment. A character can only benefit from a medkit once for any single set of injuries.

#### Magic
- Sorcery + Magic (using Healing or similar spell)

The wonders of magic are many and great. Healing spells are some of the most commonly studied magics for those working on the streets. Some use their skills to earn a little extra cash patching up gangers; others serve on a runner team, keeping their partners fighting when the bullets start finding their targets. Those with hearts of gold work as regular street healers to give the denizens of the barrens a chance at a healthy life.

The good news about magical healing is it works at the speed of a spell—once the spell is cast, the effect takes hold.

Healing magic can mend both Physical and Stun injuries, but not those caused by Drain. The leftover taint of wearisome mana prevents the healing magics from connecting to that damaged tissue to heal it. As with medkits, net effect can be used to heal 4 points of Stun, Physical, or Overflow Damage per Effect. For more information on casting healing spells, see Magic.

A character can be healed by Magic only once for any single set of injuries.

#### Natural Recovery/Medical Assistance (Varies by damage type)

After all other options have been used, if injury remains, it’s all about rest and possibly some help from a trained medical professional (or just your team medic). Rest is simply defined as not engaging in any strenuous physical or mental activity—essentially, anything that involves a dice roll would break your rest. Medical attention offers a bonus to the recovery roll. If any person trained in Biotech is watching over the character for at least half of their rest period, the wounded individual gains a +2 Effect to the healing tests defined below.

To heal Physical Damage, roll `Body + Body (1)` once per day. Each Effect heals 4 points of Physical Damage after that day of rest.

To heal Stun Damage, roll `Body + Willpower (1)` once per hour. Each hit heals 4 points of Stun Damage after that hour of rest. A full 8 hour (Long Reat) rest will recover all lost Stun Health.

#### Overflow & Dying

Sometimes a hit brings you closer to death than you ever really want to be, and you’ve got some Damage Overflow to recover. These points are healed just like Physical Damage and need to be healed before the character can return to the land of the conscious. Note that if a character receives (Body x 2) points of Overflow damage, they are dead and gone, beyond the reach of any kind of healing.

### Status List
The different statuses used in Shadowrun, Sixth World are described below.


#### Blinded I, II, III

Whether it’s flashing lights, some specialized chemical, or the pure force of magic, there are plenty of ways to make it impossible for shadowrunners to see. For the first two levels of this status, characters take a –3 penalty per level to all tests involving visibility. At the third level, characters automatically fail any tests involving visibility.

#### Burning #

The Burning status is the result of being hit with a flame-based attack. Once the initial blow has done its damage, you have to deal with the continuing heat and flames, and the parts of yourself that may be on fire. 

The status should be noted with a number that indicates the amount of Physical damage the character must resist each round while the status exists. There are multiple ways to remove this status. You can spend a Major Action and roll an `Quickness + Reaction (2) test`; success means the fire is out and the status is removed. You can also jump into water to remove the status without a roll.

If you gain the Wet and/or Chilled statuses, the Burning status is canceled. Similarly, gaining the Burning status cancels the Wet or Chilled status.

#### Charmed
- A charmed creature can’t attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.
- The charmer has +3 on any test to interact socially with the creature.

#### Chilled

When you are truly, damagingly cold, it seeps into your bones and won’t let go, and you can’t move as smoothly and nimbly as you would like. When you are Chilled, you get –4 to your Initiative Score and –1 to all tests. This status cancels and is canceled by the Burning status.

#### Confused #

Colors, patterns, and weird ideas swirl around your head, keeping you from being able to focus, which makes your actions uncoordinated and awkward. The number after the status acts as a penalty on any test you take.

#### Corrosive #

Acids, bases, and other caustics eat into your flesh and don’t stop. The ongoing damage from these chemicals is noted with the Corrosive status, which comes with a number after it to denote how much damage the ongoing effect inflicts. 

This status can be removed with certain gear (like baking soda for acids!) and equipment. The Wet status does not necessarily remove it, as some chemicals continue burning the skin even after contact with water. The gamemaster can determine when enough water has been applied to remove the chemical in question.

#### Cover I, II, III, IV

Whether you hide behind a wall, a dumpster, or a body, Cover is protection from hostile fire. It comes at four levels, indicating how much of a character’s body is protected (one-quarter, onehalf, three quarters, or all). A character in Cover gets a +2 bonus per Cover level to their Defense Rating. Attacking from Cover requires an extra Minor Action in order to get clear enough to take a shot, imposes a –2 penalty to your attack at Cover IV, and you cannot gain Bonus Effect while attacking from Cover (you can gain it from defending).

#### Dazed

One too many thumps to the head, or maybe the solar plexus, leaves the character woozy and unable to act with their normal alacrity. The character reduces their Initiative Score by –4, and they cannot gain or spend Edge (but they can burn Edge) as long as they have this Status.

#### Deafened I, II, III

Whether you heard a sudden, hugely loud clap, or someone stuffed your ears full of cotton-like mana, sound waves are not getting through so that your brain can tell you what they mean. For the first two levels of this status, characters take a –3 penalty per level to all tests involving hearing. At the third level, characters automatically fail any tests involving hearing.

#### Fatigued I, II, III

At its top level, this status is that dreamlike weariness, where your legs are lead and just will. Not. Move. Characters with this status take a –2 penalty per level to all tests. Characters move at 5 yards per turn instead of 10 for walking, and 10 instead of 15 for sprinting.

#### Frightened

Something has hit your lizard brain, and rational thought flees. All you have left is fear. Characters take a –4 penalty to any tests directed to or defending against the source of the effect. They also cannot move toward the source of their fear. 

#### Hazed

Something has messed up your connection to the astral world, leaving that realm out of your reach. Or worse, if you were already astral, you’re stuck there. A character with this status is unable to move between the astral plane and the physical world. They cannot astrally project or manifest. They may still perceive astrally.

#### Hobbled

Any movement on foot, whether by the Move, Sprint, or Avoid Incoming action, is halved (round up). Said another way it cost twice movement to move.

#### Immobilized

Just what it sounds like! Characters with this status cannot move, though they can take any actions that will function with their feet stuck to the ground. Their Attack Rating is reduced by 3, and they take a –3 penalty on all attacks. They cannot use Reaction on their Defense tests.

#### Incapacitated
- An incapacitated creature can’t take actions or reactions.

#### Invisible #

The go-to status for sneak thieves. Characters are less visible to living and sentient beings. The number after the status indicates the threshold step people must hit on a Perception test to notice the character with this status. Cameras and other inorganic methods of visibility detection can see someone with this status as normal.

#### Invisible (Improved) #

The same as Invisibility, but it also affects camera and other technological ways of seeing.

#### Nauseated

Your stomach heaves, your head spins, and you have trouble thinking about anything other than not throwing up. Characters must pass a `Body + Willpower (2)` test at the start of a combat round. If they fail, they cannot take an action that round. If they succeed, they can act, but they lose a Minor Action.

#### Panicked

The drek has hit the fan, and it has splattered everywhere, and you have lost the ability to act in any sort of a coherent fashion. Characters with this status cannot act except to avoid the condition that is causing the Panicked effect.

#### Petrified

There is a good reason why you don’t want to be in the wrong end of a basilisk stare, and this is it. The character is essentially turned into solid material. They cannot take any actions, and they get a +10 Armor Rating. This cancels any other damaging statuses the character may have been experiencing.

#### Poisoned #

Something wrong has gotten into the character’s body, and it’s going to mess them up until it works its way through. This status has a damage code after it, with a number and an indication for either Physical or Stun damage. At the end of each combat round when this status exists, the character must take the damage. The damage decreases by 1 each round. Antidotes, both physical and magical, can remove this status.

#### Prone

One of the classics—you drop to the ground to get a stable shot and make yourself tougher to shoot. The character’s movement rate is reduced to two yards, and they cannot Sprint. They get a +3 bonus on Defense Tests against ranged attacks from Medium range or farther, but –3 on attacks from Close or Near ranges due to their immobility. They also get a –4 penalty to melee attacks or bow attacks. They increase the Attack Rating of any firearm or projectile weapon (besides bows) by 2.

#### Silent #

Your ability to make noise is greatly hindered. The number after the status indicates the threshold step people must hit on a Perception test to hear the character with this status. Microphones and other inorganic methods of audio detection can pick up sounds of someone with this status as normal.

#### Silent (Improved) #
The same as Silent, except microphones and other forms of technology are also affected.

#### Stilled

There’s bad news and good news! The bad news is you can’t move. Your feet are absolutely stuck in place. You get a –10 penalty on your Defense Rating against incoming attacks (minimum 0), and you can’t take any actions beyond Perception and mental communication, should you be able to do that. You also cannot roll tests. The good news is, being Stilled halts any ongoing damage or other effects on the character. New damage may be inflicted, but any ongoing effects from it will also be canceled by this status.

#### Stunned
- A stunned creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can’t move, and can speak only falteringly.
- The creature automatically fails reactions
- Defense Score is at a -3 penalty.

#### Unconcious
- An Unconscious character is Incapacitated, can’t move or speak, and is unaware of their surroundings.
- The character drops whatever they’re holding and falls Prone.
- Any attack that hits the character is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet.

#### Wet

Whether it’s a pouring rain, a sudden wave, or the efforts of a rampaging water spirit, you are soaked from head to toe. You take double damagefrom cold and electricity damage. Cancels the Burning status, is canceled by the Burning status, and may affect the Corrosive status.

#### Zapped

A jolt of electrical power has hit you, leaving you fried and scattered. Your muscles aren’t working quite right, either. The character suffers a –2 to their Initiative Score, the inability to take the Sprint Action, and a penalty of –1 on all actions.

### Damage Types

Certain weapons and attacks deliver damage besides simple kinetic energy transfer. These forms of attacks, such as flamethrowers, fireballs, lightning bolts, tasers, and toxic waves to name a few, usually have a secondary and/or extended Status effect beyond the initial attack and damage result.

#### Electricity

Getting zapped not only hurts, but it also seizes muscles and leaves a victim shaky from muscle tremors. If a character shakes off the damage, they’re all good, but if they suffer even a single box, the character gets the Zapped status for 2 combat rounds.

#### Chemical (acids, bases, caustics, etc.) 

Attacks that involve corrosive chemicals—acids, bases, caustics, toxins, etc.—tend to stick around and cause damage on subsequent rounds. Chemical attacks add the Corrosive status. Additionally, if the modified Damage Value of an attack exceeds the Armor of the target, the Defense boost from that piece of armor is permanently decreased by one after the attack is resolved.

#### Cold

No one likes being cold. The shakes, chattering teeth, hypothermia, and tissue damage are just a few reasons your life will be harder after you get hit by a cold-based attack. Taking damage from an attack with a Cold damage type inflicts the Chilled status for 3 combat rounds. Lastly, if the modified Damage Value of an attack exceeds the Armor of the target, the Defense boost from that piece of armor is permanently decreased by one after the attack is resolved.

#### Fire

Once you’re hit by an attack that involves fire, the fire ignites flammable objects, including you. This effect means the fire burns for several rounds after the first. Taking damage from an attack with a Fire damage type inflicts the Burning status.

Gamemaster note: The damage and duration are subject to your discretion if the target has some mitigating circumstance. If they’re covered in oil or wearing a lot of loose-fitting cloth, it may last longer, cause more damage, or require a higher threshold to extinguish.



## Chapter 9: Magic


## The Matrix

In the Sixth World, information is power. Nowhere is this more true than on the Matrix. It is ubiquitous, connecting everything from office workstations to home-automation systems. From bleeding-edge advanced prototypes to ten-year-old burner commlinks, the Matrix is everywhere. Technically speaking, the Matrix is the interconnection of all worldwide devices, wireless or otherwise, that use the same protocols and methods for communication. In a more abstract sense, the Matrix is a vast shared virtual space, home to the entirety of metahuman knowledge, with a fair bit of imagination and outright lies mixed in. Everyday users access the Matrix for many tasks in the course of their day, searching for trideos of cats, answering phone calls, remotely turning on their car, controlling a logging drone, or monitoring cameras, among other things.

Hackers (Deckers), on the other hand, make the Matrix do what they want, legally or otherwise. Some, called deckers after the equipment they use, do it with high-tech devices called cyberdecks.

Matrix-based devices and defenses are so common that a character competent in using or bypassing such things is integral to any runner team. Hackers earn their pay disabling alarms and auto-defenses, scrambling enemy communications, and destroying anything that connects to the Matrix. They act as the team’s communications hub, safeguarding them from virtual attack. They’re also the go-to specialists when it comes to digging out information, either in a general search or a quest for specific piece of data they can fence or ransom for cash.

### Matrix History

The Matrix, as we know it in the Sixth World, is the third iteration of what used to be called the in ternet or World Wide Web. Around the turn of the millennium, it took off and grew incredibly fast, adding new technologies for enhanced stability and speed at an almost daily rate.

Then, in 2029, things took a turn for the worse. A fast-moving and destructive virus unlike anything the world had seen began taking down large swaths of network infrastructure, destroying software and hardware alike. The United States organized an elite squad of hackers, technicians, and network wizards and equipped them with newly developed techniques for direct neural interface, then sent them against the virus. Echo Mirage, as the “cyber-commandos” were known, took heavy casualties as lethal biofeedback from the Crash Virus shocked and cooked their brains. Undeterred, they pressed on, and eventually scrubbed the Virus from the network—but the damage had been done.

The demise of the old internet and the Crash of ’29 gave rise to the Matrix, an advanced network designed to run with the human-computer interfaces used exclusively by crack teams like Echo Mirage in the past. The direct neural links that at one point required psychoactive drugs, massive amounts of cable, and a sensory-deprivation tank to use now only took a much-smaller computer and a small piece of cyberware called a datajack. The datajack was implanted directly into a user’s head, acting as a port for a cable that would connect a computer to the metahuman brain.

As time went on, virtual space grew more and more complex, and it became commonplace for workers to spend their entire day “jacked in.” Not every technological leap forward was a boon, though. Pushing the envelope on advanced, semi-autonomous programs, Renraku stumbled into creating the first artificial intelligence. Later, born from the dissection of Renraku’s creation, another AI—one hostile to metahumanity—came into being. The shockwaves caused by this AI, in addition to a perfect storm of other factors, turned out to be too much for the Matrix. The network collapsed completely in 2064, an event now known as the Second Crash (or Crash 2.0).

Out of the ashes of the old Matrix came the Matrix as we know it today. It is primarily a wireless network, and corporations have taken extensive steps to stop would-be hackers through the implementation of the Grid Overwatch Division. Yet, despite the chokehold corporations hold over the Matrix, its mysteries run deep. Some infrastructure is decades old, and unknown to even the savviest virtual crusaders. Even more strangely, some metahumans are able to access the Matrix without using any sort of equipment at all. In the corporations’ eyes, these technomancers are both a security threat and a valuable commodity as a new evolution of metahumanity.

### The Matrix in Daily Life

Using the Matrix is an everyday task for most of the Sixth World, though some immerse themselves in it, allowing their perceptions to be overridden by simsense. Either way, to make the Matrix do what you want, you must first understand what you’re looking at. If you’re interacting with the Matrix through the screen of a commlink held in your hand, what you see will look vastly different than if you were using augmented reality (AR) or virtual reality (VR). This is the most rudimentary use of the Matrix, allowing for things such as commcalls, messaging, and use of basic media, including music and games. When using a commlink, various programs can help you navigate from place to place through voice or touch commands. Through these, you can access various hosts and interface with augmented-reality objects (AROs) nearby, allowing them to appear as a sort of pop-up window on the commlink screen.

When you enter augmented reality, whether you use an implanted image link, AR-capable glasses, a datajack, or a technomancer’s innate perception, your perspective on the world around you will change dramatically. The “real world” still exists, but virtual icons interact and overlap with it. A mechanic might use an AR display to provide a digital outline and manual for an engine to assist them with repairs. Entering a posh new restaurant, you may be greeted with a wine list and a menu, along with the day’s specials, hovering alongside you as you walk. An old warehouse can be turned into a vibrant dance club with bright icons and swirling glitter that have no physical substance.

Using AR is essentially dipping a toe into the greater virtual reality of the Matrix. You can see the Matrix sprawling out around you, but real-life rules still apply. Your speed in AR is limited by how fast your body can move, and you can only see as far as you normally could, making the abstract infinity of the Matrix seem impossibly far away at times. Even so, this small dip into the Matrix can greatly alter the world around you, as advertisements, virtual overlays, and the myriad of wireless devices provide stark contrast with reality’s frequent dullness.

To take things a step further, you’ll have to immerse yourself in full virtual reality. In VR, the perceptions of the real world fall away; your consciousness is subsumed into the Matrix, and your senses are overridden by the ASIST (Artificial Sensory Induction Systems Technology) interface, more commonly known as simsense. Before you stretches an infinite black horizon, dotted with brightly colored images. 

These icons represent anything that can be interacted with in the Matrix. In their default mode, an icon appears as a featureless white sphere—but seeing such an icon is a rarity, thanks to the amount of customization available. Icons for parked cars look like virtual representations of what they are, and icons for individual personal area networks (PANs) are often represented by animated characters, or hyper-realistic versions of their owner’s subjective view of perfection. Ultimately, an icon can appear in whatever way the owner chooses, with the higher-end icons being incredibly detailed and sculpted. Beyond individual PANs, huge icons loom over the virtual horizon, representing those with the most power over the Matrix, the corporations that make it run. These monumental icons are the public gateways to the individual hosts of those corporations, replete with propaganda extolling the virtues of the company in glowing corporate-speak—and sometimes, coupons!

Icons whose hosts are closest to your meat body appear closer, with physically far-away hosts seeming out of sight of your virtual perceptions. Of course, physics is just a suggestion within the Matrix, and traveling these distances in the blink of an eye is as simple as willing yourself to your destination. Still other icons and access points exist, so that people across the globe can log on whever they want.

For all of the official control, though, there are corners of the Matrix that are still unknown. Whether these are the result of older corporate networks hanging on as part of the new Matrix, the expansion of artificial intelligence, or the manifestation of the mysterious source of power that technomancers call the Resonance is yet to be revealed.

### Matrix Security: Grid Overwatch Division

In the wake of the Second Crash in 2064, the new Matrix that was born from the ashes of the old one gave rise to widespread wireless technology. No longer did users have to use a cable to jack into the Matrix—now, they could wirelessly connect from anywhere they could receive a signal. The network had become such a reliable mesh that roaming between grids became the norm. A hacker could conceivably never leave their home and still interact with (and break into) any number of devices and hosts around the world, using only their commlink.

That all changed in the mid-2070s, when the Corporate Court Matrix Authority created the Grid Overwatch Division, or GOD. Initially, this organization comprised representatives of the Big Ten megacorporations who propped up the Matrix after the Crash, and it was tasked with keeping an eye on the emergence of artificial intelligences. Their authority was soon expanded to make them a watchdog group responsible for tracking down illegal use of the Matrix—and to help define what was and was not legal. This practice was adopted individually by other corporations, who formed their own internal groups, colloquially known as demi-GODs.

With the increase in GOD’s power, the Wild West era of the new Matrix was all but over. Still, there are those who know how to fly under the radar, at least for little while, before they are caught.


### Personas and Attributes

Personas are the “people” of the Matrix. They’re primarily metahumans, but personas can also be programs, agents, intrusion countermeasures (IC or “ice”), and (rarely) artificial intelligences. Just like living beings in the meat world, personas have attributes and skills that determine how well they function. The skills you have in the meat world carry over to the Matrix, though they are not always useful (your persona may look like it’s firing a gun, but the Firearms skill is of little use in the Matrix— what looks like an attack is an action covered by another skill; see Matrix Actions).

Attributes are somewhat different. Your Mental attributes carry over into the Matrix, but your Physical attributes are replaced by four Matrix attributes: Attack, Sleaze, Data Processing, and Firewall (ASDF).

Attack represents the offensive power of the device in cybercombat and how much damage it can do when attacking.

- Sleaze is the stealth attribute of the persona and represents how easy it is to hide and blend in with its surroundings, appearing as a normal icon among others, essentially disappearing.

- Data Processing is the raw computing power of a device. Data Processing governs how quickly a device can operate and contributes to running programs concurrently. 

- Firewall is a persona’s primary defensive attribute. It represents how well-defended the persona is against attempts to take unauthorized actions.

If you’re a decker, your Matrix attributes are determined by the device you’re using to access the Matrix. If the device doesn’t possess one or more of the Matrix attributes, then the applicable attribute is treated as if it were 0. You can rotate any non-zero attributes through your persona, even if they originated from different devices. 

Devices also have a Matrix Condition Monitor, which is equal to `(Device Rating / 2, rounded up) + 8`. 

All tests using a damaged device have a –1 modifier for every three full boxes of Matrix damage, until the device is repaired. If a device’s Matrix Condition Monitor is filled up, it is bricked (see Bricked Devices, below).

### Bricked Devices

A bricked device is one whose formerly complex functioning has been reduced to that of a slab of nonfunctional material. That is to say, it doesn’t work, plain and simple, since its Condition Monitor has been filled. For the most part, meat-world observers of a bricked device can tell when something goes wrong—sparks, popping noises, and smoke are clear indicators of a problem. Users of a bricked device are abruptly ejected from the Matrix, and VR users have to deal with dumpshock. The device will not work again until it is repaired.

### Repairing Matrix Damage


What’s broken can often be fixed, with the proper tools, time, and talent. Repairing a damaged device is an `Hardware + Intelligence (number of boxes, 1 hour Extended test`. 

The device cannot be used while it is being repaired, and repairs cannot be performed without a toolkit. A critical glitch on a repair test means you messed up good—the device fails totally and will never work again.

### Overwatch Score and Convergence

When hacking, note the number of Effect scored by the defender. This is not net effect, but all effect scored in the test. This total becomes the Overwatch Score (OS). When the OS reaches 40, Convergence occurs.

Convergence is GOD zeroing in on your location. When this occurs, the device used to perform the last hacking test is bricked (its Condition Monitor is filled), and the user is dumped from the Matrix, with associated dumpshock. Additionally, the user’s physical location is reported to the authorities so they might send people to track you down.

Things that increase the Overwatch Score are as follows:

- Using hacking programs: OS increases by 1 for each Matrix action modified by a hacking program. Simply having the program loaded without actively using it doesn’t increase your OS.)

- Performing hacking actions (as noted above): +1 OS per effect on the opposing roll, whether the defense was successful or not.

- Every round you are connected to a Device or Sytem you are not supposed to the OS will go up 1 unless you make your Detection Test

- During Cybercombat your OS goes up 1 automatically every round without a Detection Test allowed.


### Dumpshock and Link-Locking

When you’re disconnected from the Matrix while in VR without gracefully switching to AR first, you suffer a nasty shock as your sim module kicks out. This happens to hackers so often that it has its own name: dumpshock. The Damage Value for dumpshock is 3S if you’re in cold-sim and 3P if you’re in hot-sim. Dumpshock is biofeedback damage, so you resist it with Willpower. As if that weren’t enough, you’re also disoriented and so cannot gain Bonus Effect or use Edge on actions for (10 – Willpower) minutes, even if you manage to soak all the damage.

Another danger in the Matrix is having your connection link-locked. This is when another persona or device sends keep-alive signals to your deck (or other device) that force it to cancel any attempt to leave the Matrix. If you’re link-locked, you can’t use the Enter/Exit Host, Reboot Device, or Switch Interface Mode actions on the device your persona is using (probably your deck). You can escape with a successful Jack Out action. Successfully jacking out usually means suffering dumpshock, but at least you’re free. Any persona, be they agent, technomancer, or sprite, can be link-locked.

Usually, if you fall unconscious in VR, your commlink or deck automatically switches you to AR. If you’re link-locked, you remain online and in VR, which can be quite dangerous. IC may attack an unconscious decker, and security spiders, being a bit smarter than IC and no less ruthless, have a lot of options to punish someone who is helpless and stuck in the Matrix. Either way, it’s nasty, since you can’t defend against actions when you’re unconscious.

### Noise

Noise represents any interference between a user and their target. Noise can be created by sheer distance or other factors, such as jamming or obstructions. Each point of noise incurs a –1 penalty to any test taken in the Matrix. If noise is greater than the device rating, the device cannot access the Matrix or provide wireless bonuses.


| PHYSICAL DISTANCE TO TARGET/OBSTACLES        | NOISE LEVEL                         |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Directly connected (any distance)            | 0                                   |
| Up to 100 yards                              | 0                                   |

| 1,001–10,000 yards (10k yds )                | 3                                   |
| 10,001 yards to 100k yds                     | 5                                   |
| Greater than 100k yds                        | 8                                   |

| Faraday cage                                 | no signal, action blocked           |
| Fresh water                                  | 1 per 6 inches                      |
| Jamming                                      | 1 per Effect on Jam Signals actions |
| Metal-laced earth or wall                    | 1 per 5 yards                       |
| Salt water                                   | 1 per 6 inches                      |
| Spam zone or static zone                     | Rating                              |
| Wireless negation (e.g., wallpaper or paint) | Rating                              |

### Cyberjacks

Cyberjacks are a fairly invasive piece of gear, implanted deep into the brain, and meant to interface more smoothly with a cyberdeck. While they can act as a simple datajack, they also perform the function of integrating the ASIST interface more directly, thus providing superior speed and response times.

They represent the Data Processing and Firewall attributes

| CYBERJACK | ATTRIBUTES (D/F) | VR MATRIX INIT DICE BONUS | AVAIL | ESS | COST     |
| --------- | ---------------- | ------------------------- | ----- | --- | -------- |

### Hacking the Matrix

To Hack into the Matrix first you need to gain access to a Device or System. You have two options (technically three) to do this.

1. The best and easiest way in, is a Hardline access through the building. You need a user and credentials otherwise you still need options 2 or 3
2. Probe your way in using Sleaze. You try to work your way in through gaps in the security you make Detection Tests each round. 
3. Brute Force your way in. This is the noisy way in. You attack the Device/Network/System Node directly. This will trigger any IC that Device has

### Systems and Devices

Whats the difference?

#### Devices

A Device is a physical electronic or mechanical object with a function or purpose, such as a commlink, smartgun, sensor, or even an appliance. Devices have an associated Device Rating, can be integrated into a mesh network, and can be wirelessly accessed or controlled through the Matrix. Hacking a device is generally done against the Device Rating (where Hosts use their Host Rating)

#### Hosts
Hosts have a general rating, which translates into their Matrix attributes. These general ratings are between 1 and 12. The ratings of these attributes are usually (host rating), (host rating + 1), (host rating + 2), and (host rating + 3), in any order. For example, a rating 4 host might have Attack 5, Sleaze 4, Data Processing 7, Firewall 6. A host’s attributes are shared by itself and its IC programs.

Host Attack Rating: Host Rating X 2

Condition Monitor: 

Initiative: (Data Processing x 2) + Ability Dice Code

- Rating 1: Personal sites, public education.
- Rating 2–3: Low-end commercial businesses, social media.
- Rating 4–5: Local and regional corporate sites, major governments.
- Rating 6+: Megacorporate headquarters, military command

Systems are really just a collection of Nodes. There are many different kinds of Nodes but the ones you care about are:

- Central Processing Unit (CPU)Each system has one, and only one, CPU. It's the brain of the system, so it's naturally the most heavily guarded
  - Allows you to Crash the System if you get access, you can completely take over the System and all Devices attach to it. Raises OS 5 a round.
- Datastores (DS) where information is stored its Rating is also the Encryption Rating (usually)
- Input Output Port (IOP) these are hardline points inside a building or system. Devices like Cameras are attached to IOP's so is every terminal.
- System Access Node (SAN) these are generally public access points with lower security, a typical access point for a Decker

### Types of IC

These are the types of IC a host may throw at unwary intruders. All IC use Host Attack Rating and (Host Rating x 2) for Condition Monitor and most rolls. Their Initiative is (Data Processing x 2) + Ability Dice Code. Defensive rolls and effects vary by IC type.

Trust me, the GM knows exactly what kind of IC you are up against.

#### Acid
- Defense: Host Rating + Firewall

Acid IC is about wearing down the defenses of intruders so that the other IC can finish it off. When Acid IC hits in cybercombat, the target’s Firewall attribute is reduced by 1 per net hit, reducing the effective defenses. Lost points are restored after leaving the host, at a rate of 1 point per minute.

#### Binder
- Defense: Firewall + Data Processing

Where Acid IC wants to reduce your defenses, Binder IC wants to slow down all of your functionality— and keep you from running as many programs as you would like. When Binder IC hits in cybercombat, the target’s Data Processing attribute is reduced by 1 per net Effect. When Data Processing hits 0, no Matrix actions can be performed until it hits 1 or higher. Lost points are restored after leaving the host, at a rate of 1 point per minute.

#### Black IC
- Defense: Host Rating + Firewall

Black IC means business. When a host tosses this out, it wants your brain fried, plain and simple. If you see this coming at you, no one would blame you for running. In cybercombat, Black IC does (host rating + net effect) in both Matrix damage and biofeedback damage.

#### Blaster
- Defense: Host Rating + Firewall

Blaster IC isn’t fun, but at least it’s not as focused on killing you as Black IC is. Yeah, it might want to subject you to all sorts of unpleasant Matrix- based torture, but you have to be alive to experience pain, so that’s something, right? In cybercombat, this does (Rating) Matrix damage while also link-locking the target.

#### Crash
- Defense: Host Rating + Firewall

Crash delivers a sweeping blow intended to take weapons out of your hand. When it hits in cybercombat, this IC does no Matrix damage; instead, it crashes one random program. Crashed programs can’t be run again until the device is rebooted.

#### Jammer
- Defense: Firewall + Attack

Jammer IC is an expert fencer who toys with you rather than killing you outright. In cybercombat, when Jammer IC hits, the target’s Attack attribute is reduced by 1 per net effect. No actions using the Attack rating can be performed when the Attack rating is 0. Lost points are restored after leaving the host, at a rate of 1 point per minute.

#### Killer
- Defense: Host Rating + Firewall

Killer IC is the choice of hosts where they don’t want to go for a bunch of fancy tactics and prefer to just leap for the jugular. When Killer IC hits in cybercombat, it does (net hits + host rating) Matrix damage to the target.

#### Marker
- Defense: Firewall + Sleaze

Marker IC is a response to too many backdoors— if hackers are going to start preferring Sleaze options to make and secure backdoors into hosts, then hosts are going to keep hackers from having high Sleaze ratings. In cybercombat, when Marker IC hits, the target’s Sleaze attribute is reduced by 1 per net hit. No actions using the Sleaze rating can be performed when the Sleaze rating is 0. Lost points are restored after leaving the host, at a rate of 1 point/minute.

#### Scramble
- Defense: Host Rating + Firewall

Scramble IC doesn’t care how hurt or damaged you are; it just wants you gone. If Scramble IC hits in cybercombat, it forces the target to reboot on the target’s next turn, unless the target is linklocked.

#### Sparky
- Defense: Host Rating + Firewall

Sparky is aggressive IC that wants to bring the damage right to the user, bypassing hardware entirely. If Sparky IC hits in cybercombat, it does (host rating + net hits) in biofeedback damage.

#### Tar Baby
- Defense: Host Rating + Firewall

Tar Baby is about slowing you down so you can be caught by other IC or you abandon the host in frustration. If Tar Baby hits in cybercombat, it forces link-lock.

#### Track
- Defense: Firewall + Sleaze

Track IC doesn’t do harm directly—it’s about gathering information in case harm needs to be done later. If it hits in cybercombat, Track IC discovers the target’s physical location.

### Regular Matrix Actions
These are used outside Cybercombat. You take 1 action a round.

#### **Brute Force**

Getting access the loud way.

This is an obvious attack and will trigger an alert. Your OS *will* go up using Attacks. This is used to get into a System. Using Brute Force will trigger Any IC if there is any

`Hacking + Intelligence` vs. `Rating + Firewall` DV = (Attack + Effect) Reduce Damage by Firewall

If attacked by a Host, IC, or Device they roll `Rating + Attack` against your `Hacking + Intelligence` and you will reduce damage by your Firewall. Damage will be applied to your Cyber Deck

#### **Probe**

Getting Access the Quiet Way.

Used to sneak into systems and not trigger an alert. As long as you are undetected (see Detection Tests) your OS will not go up. This requires a Detection Test.

`Hacking + Intelligence` vs. `Rating + Firewall` Sleaze + Effect applies to Detection Test

#### **Matrix Search**

Search the publicly accessible grid for information. The number of effect generated gives you more information regarding the subject.

`Hacking + Intelligence` vs. `Sleaze + Firewall`

#### **Encrypt/Decrypt File**

Decrypts a file or Encrypts a file on the Host. Usually used after a Matrix Search. This requires a Detection Test.

`Hacking + Intelligence vs. Encryption Rating` Effect + Data Processing will weaken Encryption.

`Hacking + Intelligence` to set Encryption Strength with Effect + Data Processing.

#### **Snoop**

This action lets you intercept Matrix traffic sent to and from your target for as long as you have access. You can listen to, view, or read this data live, or you can save it for later playback/viewing if you have something to store it on (your deck or commlink will do). This requires a Detection Test.

`Hacking + Intelligence vs. Rating + Firewall` Effect + Data Processing applies to Detection Roll


#### **Control Device**

You take control of a device (like a camera). You own it as long as you control it. This is an obvious action and will raise your OS in the System. You can control 1 device per Data Processing of your Deck.

`Hacking + Intelligence vs. Rating + Firewall` Effect + Data Processing for how long you will control the device.

#### Analyze

This allows you to Analyze a Node or Device you are wanting information about. Analyze will tell you on a success the Rating, if it has IC. Each Net Effect can tell you a piece of information. This requires a Detection Test.

`Electronics + Intuition vs Device Sleaze + Firewall` Sleaze + Effect will tell you a piece of Information.

#### **Jack Out**

This logs you out and resets your Deck immediately. You will have Dumpshock if you do this during Cybercombat.

#### Check OS Score

Does not require a roll will tell you what your Current OS score is. This requires a Detection Test.

### Detection Rolls

This works a lot a like resisting, Drain does for an Awakened Character. You need to roll to avoid Detection if you fail your OS goes up. Any action you take (except Attack because it guarantees OS will go up) you roll to avoid Detection.

`Hacking + Intelligence` vs. `Rating + your current OS` failure means you take the Net Effect to your OS

Once OS reaches 40 they are detected and Dumped out of the Matrix and their Deck is Bricked.
