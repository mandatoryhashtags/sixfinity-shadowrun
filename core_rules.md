## What is Sixfinity?

SIRE is a 1D12 TTRPG system created by CJ Schrum to be a generic system used to play any kind of TTRPG. It was influenced by his near thirty years of table top games in nearly every ruleset created. 


## Shadowrun Setting

What better challenge for a generic TTRPG system than to convert one of the more crunchy games that was ever created? Effect was added to the game specifically to accomplish the Shadowrun feel. It is not in the core Sixfinity experience.

### Statistics (STATS)
Each of the STATS ranges 1-6 (for Humans) but can go higher for other Metatypes.

There are five STATS and four special STATS.

> Essence was added for Shadowrun

---

**S.T.A.T.S**

---


**Stamina**

This represents the general strength, sturdiness, integrity, and health of the individual. It sometimes is correlated to size—trolls tend to have high Stamina ratings— but this is not a perfect correlation, as dwarfs tend to have higher Stamina ratings than humans. Stamina’s uses include resisting damage and toxins.

**Talent**

Talent represents a character’s memorizing ability and raw brain power. It denotes how fast a character learns, how much she can re- member, and how well she can execute pre-planned sequences. A Talent-lacking character might get overwhelmed when confronted with a lot of details and may have a poor memory—especially for facts and figures. Characters with a high Talent rating will likely be excellent book-learners, able to deal with computer and magic theory with ease, and capable of building (and tearing down!) machinery and electronics. 

**Agility**

Agility represents fine motor control—manual Agility, flexibility, balance, and coordination. A character with a low Agility may be someone with an inner-ear problem, one leg that is shorter than the other, or a simple klutz. Higher Agility ratings may belong to charac- ters that are “natural” athletes.

**Tenacity**

Tenacity keeps a character going when she wants to give up, or enables her to control her habits and emotions. Tenacity determines whether or not a character is going to take charge of her life. A charac- ter with low Tenacity might defer to other people when big decisions are being made, for example. A high-Tenacity character is more as- sured and possesses a never-say-die streak. Such characters go down to the monowire because that’s exactly the fragging point. Tenacity also represents a character’s cool under fire, her ability to resist intimida- tion and manipulation, and her resolve to stick to her guns when the
pressure is on.

**Social**

Social is a nebulous STATS. More than just looks, Social represents a character’s personal aura, self-image, ego, willingness to find out what people want and give it to them, and ability to recognize what she can and can’t get out of people. A whiny demeanor, a me-first attitude, or an inability to read Stamina language or subtle hints are just a few traits that can give a character low Social. A character with high Social might simply enjoy entertaining others, may excel at making friends and/or manipulating people, or may be all flash and fun with whomever it is today. A high-Social character might deliver jokes at the right moment, have a sexy way of carrying herself, or com- mand respect because her timing is always impeccable.

---

**Special**

Please note Resonance is not used in Sixfinity if it is referenced ignore it.

**Magic**

Not all characters have this STATS; it is only for magic-using characters, who are generally referred to as Awakened characters. It measures their Stamina in channeling mana into spectacular effects.

**Reaction**

A character’s Reaction is, quite simply, her physical reflexes—how quickly she can react to a changing situation, and how well she can dodge the physical slings and arrows that shadowrunning brings. A character with a high Reaction is more likely to be on top of a situation and will be in a better position to react to danger, while low-Reaction characters will lag behind. Think of it like your Reflex saving throw from other games.

Reaction = (Agility + Talent) /2 Rounded down. E.g., Agility 6 and Talent 2 → Reaction 4.

**Intuition**

Intuition is your gut instinct, your sudden inspiration, your flash of insight that doesn’t seem to make any sense but still works. Intuition helps characters react to danger, perceive threats, and resist some magic threats. Think of it like your Mental saving throw from other games. 

Intuition = (Talent + Tenacity) /2 Rounded Down E.g., Talent 2 and Wisdom 4 -> Intuition 3

**Essence**

All characters have this STATS, starting at 6. It is a measure of how many augmentations characters can hold. The metahuman Stamina can only contain so much ’ware before it loses the small spark that separates a living being from a machine. This STATS primarily exists due to the degrees of difference between biology and technology—it simply does not flow well through technology and becomes limited as your Essence declines (specifically, anytime your Essence goes below any whole integer, you lose a corresponding point of Magic or Resonance). Also, some magic, particularly healing magic, has less of an effect on you as you gain more augmentations. Finally, if your Essence ever reaches 0, you die

### Priority System

In Sixfinity character generation is based on the Priority System. The Priority System is a table with the following columns: Metatype, STATS, Magic, Skills, and Resources. The rows are divided into Priority Levels ranging from Priority A to Priority E. Players assign a specific Priority Level for each of the columns to their character depending on their preferences. The values assigned must be different for each column (representing each aspect of the character), and there can be no duplications. For example, a character may not have Priority Level B for Magic and Priority B for Resources. The higher the Priority Level (A, B, etc.), the more valuable it is for the character. Characters use Experience later on to customize their characters even further.


Regardless of Priority all starting characters get 25 Experience to spend on their character to flesh them out, make then unique.

**Priority System Table**


| Priority | Metatype  | STATS Points | Magic: starting rating & spells | Skills | Resources |
| -------- | --------- | ------------ | ------------------------------- | ------ | --------- |
| A        | Metahuman | 20           | Magic:6, 10 Spells              | 40     | 450k      |
| B        | Human 3   | 18           | Magic:4, 7 Spells               | 30     | 275k      |
| C        | Human 2   | 15           | Magic:3, 5 Spells               | 24     | 140k      |
| D        | Human 1   | 12           | Magic:2                         | 20     | 50k       |
| E        | Human 0   | 10           | -                               | 17     | 6k        |

**Metatype STATS Starting and Maximum Values**


| METATYPE | Stamina | Talent | Agility | Tenacity | Social | SPECIAL FEATURES                          |
| -------- | ------- | ------ | ------- | -------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Human    | 1/6     | 1/6    | 1/6     | 1/6      | 1/6    |                                           |
| Elf      | 1/6     | 1/6    | 2/7     | 1/6      | 3/8    | Low-Light Vision                          |
| Dwarf    | 2/7     | 1/6    | 1/6     | 2/7      | 1/6    | Thermographic Vision, Resist:Disease Adv. |
| Orc      | 5/9     | 1/5    | 1/6     | 1/6      | 1/5    | Low-Light Vision                          |
| Troll    | 5/10    | 1/4    | 1/5     | 1/5      | 1/4    | Thermographic Vision, +1 Armor            |


**Step One**

Pick a Concept for your character

**Step Two**

The four levels of Human. Human 0 gets no benefit, Human 1, 2, 3 all get the number as additional STATS points to spend. So a Human 3 (Priority B) who chose Priority A for their STATS would have 30 STATS points to Spend. 

Pick Metatype Priority. Pick STATS Priority and Spend the points. 1 point cost 1 point.

**Step Three**

Choose Magic.

**Step Four**

Pick Skills Priority and spend Skill Points the maximum starting skill for any starting Skill is 4.

**Step Five**

Pick Resources Priority and purchase starting gear

**Step Six**

Spend leftover Experience

**Step Seven**

Final Touches and Derived STATS.

### Derived STATS

#### Defense
We use Opposed Tests for Defense. Players roll all the dice in Sixfinity.

Dodge Attack: `1D12 + Reaction + Intuition`

If you beat the target's Rating Difficulty they miss.

#### Physical Health

Physical Health = 8 + Stamina Score

This is not a lot of health. Cover and armor are critical to the game. 

If you had a Stamina Score of 4 you you would have 12 Health.

If you had Stamina Score 6 you would have 14 Health.

Once you reach 0 health you are Unconscious and begin bleeding to death. You can bleed until you max your Overflow and then you are dead.

#### Stun Health

Stun Health = 8 + Tenacity Score

This is where Stun Damage is recorded. If it reaches 0 you fall Unconscious and any further damage begins to affect Physical.

#### Overflow

This is how far into the Negatives you can go before you die. 

Overflow = (2 × Stamina)

If you had a Stamina of 5 you would have an Overflow of 10

#### Movement

Base movement for any character is 10 Yards.

#### Initiative

Initiative is used to determine who goes first in combat. Add your Reaction for your base, then write how many Initiative Dice you have. You start with a default of 1; this may be increased by augmentations. It looks like this when written: 9 + 1D12

Initiative = Reaction + 1D12 (+XD12 from gear)

#### Edge Pool

Edge Pool = [((Agility + Talent + Tenacity)) / 4] Round down minimum 1

So if you had a Agility of 3, Talent of 5, and Tenacity of 6, you would have a Edge Pool of 3

`(3 + 5 + 6) = 14 / 4 = 3.5 rounded down to 3`


### Character Advancement

In this game you spend your experience you gain at the end of the sessions to increase your charatcer during downtimes. 

| Desired Effect                   | XP Cost         |
| -------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Raise a STAT                     | Next rating X 5 |
| Raise an active skill            | New Rating X 2  |
| Raise a Knowledge/Language Skill | New Rating      |
| New Knowledge/Language Skill     | 2               |
| New Active Skill                 | 4               |
| New Spell                        | 5               |

## Chapter 2: Metatype
// Locked for Playtest

### Humans (homo sapiens sapiens)
- Average height: 5'6
- Average weight: 140 pounds
- Ears: Rounded
- Known for: Average size; average build; freaking out about people who don’t meet their averages
- Racial qualities: Humans have no extra racial qualities.

As the majority of the sentient beings of the world, humans create existing definitions of “normal,” and then some of them set out to abuse those definitions as hard as they can. These humans know that they lack the pure physical Stamina and social cohesion of some of the other metatypes, so they shape the world in a way that keeps the individuals they don’t like from ever realizing what they can do, and what they can become. The side effect of this, of course, is that many humans are caught up in the demoralizing machinery that the ruling corporate class has assembled, because they don’t fit into this artificial average. They are grist for the mill, people to be chewed up and spat out in the name of greater wealth and power for the people at the top. Because they’re humans, and there are so many of them, who’s going to notice how they’re ground down, and who is going to miss them when they’re gone? The shadows are full of humans who could not find a way to be normal or average.

### Elves (homo sapiens nobilis)
- Average height: 1.9 yards
- Average weight: 80 kg
- Ears: Pointy
- Known for: Slender, lithe build; being attractive and knowing it
- Racial qualities: Elves have low-light vision

Perhaps the most infuriating thing about elves to the other metatypes is that you can resent them like hell, and they just won’t care. They have two prosperous nations—Tír na nÓg (formerly known as Ireland) and Tír Tairngire (in the western part of North America)—they have people in some of the most powerful positions in the world, and celebrities whose MeFeed hits are in the billions. They are envied, not looked down on. But plenty of elves know that this envy does not extend to every elf. If you’re an elf who is not rich, elegant, or graceful, you’re often viewed as a failure, someone who had all the gifts of life handed to them and somehow screwed them up. And it’s not just nonelves who hold this view. Never mind that you might have grown up poor, never mind what obstacles you had to face—people think you automatically had it easy because you’re an elf. But elf society is not easy to survive. The upper crust can be absolutely ruthless about enforcing their status quo, labeling those who don’t fit as malcontents and finding ways to cast them aside. The barrens of the major sprawls of the world have plenty of elves who were thrown out because they wouldn’t cave to what society wanted them to be. Their anger could burn the whole earth.

### Dwarfs (homo sapiens pumilionis)
Average height: 1.2 yards
- Average weight: 54 kg
- Ears: Slightly pointy
- Known for: Short size; stocky build; perseverance
- Racial qualities: Dwarfs have thermographic vision and toxin resistance.

Sixth World dwarfs are often accepted into mainstream society without being fully valued. The taller metatypes seem to be happiest when dwarfs fit the roles they have preconceived for them— sidekicks, drivers, mechanics, that sort of thing. It doesn’t help that their size helps them squeeze into vehicles that orks, humans, and elves might have difficulty with, ones that trolls couldn’t even consider using. Still, they get work and little direct hate. They’re treated nicely, but they can’t help but feel that they’re being, well, overlooked. Dwarfs across the globe are dedicated to showing that they cannot be ignored. Dwarf deckers, street samurai, covert ops specialists, faces, and more are popping up in the international shadows, and others underestimate them at their peril. The lack of heightened antipathy against dwarfs helped them assimilate in human communities better than other metatypes. This means that they do not have as many of their own enclaves as some of the other metatypes (it also doesn’t help that they don’t have access to whatever stream of revenue the elves tap into build their kingdoms). With the founding of the dwarf-centric Biloxi Technical Institute, southern Mississippi in the CAS is becoming a dwarf haven. What that will grow into and how that will shape the world is anyone’s guess.


### Orks (homo sapiens robustus)
- Average height: 1.9 yards
- Average weight: 128 kg
- Ears: Pointy- Known for: Big, powerful physique; tusks; constantly being seen as outsiders
- Racial qualities: Orks have low-light vision and the Built Tough (1) quality

Orks make people nervous, and people don’t like to be nervous. Their tusks, bone structure, and pointed ears mark them as something altogether else, and their Stamina and size clearly show the damage they could do. As humans have done for centuries, they address the thing they fear by pushing them aside, keeping orks from building collective Stamina, and crushing them with the sheer force of numbers. That approach works as long as you can keep fear stoked and have it immobilize the masses. Because if people can move past the fear and start to understand the deliberate injustice that has been forced on some groups, they separate themselves from society’s machine, and the number of people used to enforce oppression gets smaller. Oppressors aren’t especially good at developing new solutions to such problems— they usually just resort to oppressing harder. So while realization of the injustices they deal with is spreading, orks across the Sixth World are preparing for things to get worse so that they can survive and set about the work of making things better. They already have some enclaves carved out for themselves— Seattle’s Underground, Atlanta’s Sweetwater Creek, Dharavi in the Indian Union—and they hope those locales will be the starting points for societies that include orks instead of fearing them.


### Trolls (homo sapiens ingentis)
- Average height: 2.5 yards
- Average weight: 300 kg
- Ears: Slightly pointy, often hidden by horns
- Known for: Being so big, you guys. Just huge. And horns.
- Racial qualities: Trolls have thermographic vision, the Built Tough (2) quality, and dermal deposits (which provide +1 to trolls’ Defense).

It’s not easy to live in a society where you look like the walking embodiment of everyone else’s nightmares. Being two to three times as large as everyone else doesn’t help much, either. It’s not a troll’s world, and most of the other residents of the world aren’t inclined to change that fact. Who wants to make space for imposing monsters? Trolls are going to have to force their way into a place in the world—of course, when they force their way in anywhere, they’re inevitably called vandals and destroyers. A significant number of trolls have looked at the way the deck is stacked against them and decided they don’t need to play the rest of the world’s game anymore. They’ll stand aside and watch the world burn—and maybe throw on an extra match every now and then. The Black Forest Troll Republic is one of the most important troll communities in the world, acting as a beacon and vision for what troll society can be while keeping a certain distance from everyone else. Whether they assimilate or build a higher wall is an open question. Trolls have the most difficult time adapting to other metatypes because their bodies are so different. It’s more than just the size and the horns— they have dermal deposits all over their bodies that make knobs, bumps, and other formations. They scrape up furniture and clothing, and make some people think twice about giving a troll a big bear hug. Especially since there are few people who can wrap their arms around a whole troll.




## Chapter 3: Contacts & Allies

A shadowrunner who goes it alone is often one
that winds up in a lonely, solitary grave. Experienced
shadowrunners build a network of people who can
provide the information and goods critical to their
work. Maybe it’s a bartender who knows the people
in their neighborhood, or an arms dealer who can get
the ammo that doesn’t flow through legal channels,
or a Lone Star officer who likes to shoot the breeze
about who just got arrested. These people and more
can be reached out to in times of need.

## Chapter 4: Rules

### How does it work?

Nearly everything is a TEST or CHECK. 

Roll `1d12 + STATS + Skill`. Total must meet or beat the Threshold.

#### This is how you play Sixfinity

 Please note in standard Sixfinity the rules are somewhat different, this adaptation of Shadowrun has a few unusual rules written just for the system but the basic ideas are all the same. 

1. The character tells the GM what they want to do. This is a character action.
2. The GM determines if that action is routine, and therefore works without needing a roll, or if there's a chance of failure.
3. If there's a chance of failure, the GM determines which STATS the task uses and the task's difficulty. How hard it will be on a scale of 1, really easy, to 10, basically impossible.
4. The player and the GM determine the skill applicable to the test, as well as any special features, qualifications, circumstances that might change the rating of the test.
5. The GM uses the difficulty to determine the target number, the threshold, which is how high the player must roll to succeed at the action. The GM doesn't have to tell the player what the threshold is, but they can give the player a hint, especially if the character would reasonably know if the action was easy, average, difficult, or impossible.
6. The player rolls the 1D12 add their skill and STATS. If they roll equal to or higher than the threshold, the character succeeds.
7. If they succeeded, the result will determine how much effect they had if its important.

That's it. That's how to do anything, whether it's identifying an unknown device, calming a raging drunk, climbing a treacherous cliff, or battling a beast. Even if you ignored all the other rules, you could still play the Sixfinity engine with just this information. The key features here are character actions, determining a task difficulty, and determining modifications.

One key component of Sixfinity is that the player rolls all the dice. In the Sixfinity engine, players always drive the action. This means they make all the die rolls. If a PC leaps out of a moving vehicle, the player rolls to see if they succeed. If a PC searches for a hidden panel, the player rolls to determine whether or not they find it. If a rock slide falls on a PC, the player rolls to try to get out of the way. If a PC and an NPC arm wrestle, the player rolls and the NPC's difficulty determines the target number or the threshold. If a PC attacks a foe, the player rolls to see if they hit. If the foe attacks the PC, the player rolls to see if they dodge the blow.

### Thresholds
Everything in Sixfinity revolves around tests. Tests revolve around Rating and Rating have Thresholds. A Threshold is minimum number that must be rolled on 1D12 in order to reach that rating. 

The goal of every player should be to reduce the Rating by as much as possible. If something says it gives a +2 or a -2 in the game it means to the Rating. Skills are added to the roll in order to see if you succeed. But rather than have the players fiddle around with adding a lot of extra stuff in the game to their rolls they only ever need to care about the total they rolled, the number on their edge dice (if they added any). The Gamemaster (GM) will reduce or increase the Rating of a test based on a lot of exterior factors. 

Trying to convince someon that you are supposed to be in that Megacorporation hallway, and you have on the right ID badges that would reduce the Rating by 1 (commonly called an Advantage) are you carrying a Rocket launcher with you well that would increase the Rating by 1 (commonly called a Disadvantage).


| Rating | Difficulty   | Threshold | Guidance                                                                             |
| ------ | ------------ | :-------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0      | Routine      |     0     | Anyone can do this basically every time. Roll for Effect.                            |
| 1      | Simple       |     3     | Most people can do this most of the time                                             |
| 2      | Standard     |     6     | Typical task requiring focus but most people can usually do this                     |
| 3      | Demanding    |     9     | Requires full attention; most people have a 50/50 chance to succeed                  |
| 4      | Difficult    |    12     | Trained People have a 50/50 chance to succeed                                        |
| 5      | Challenging  |    15     | Even trained people often fail                                                       |
| 6      | Intimidating |    18     | Normal people almost never succeed                                                   |
| 7      | Formidable   |    21     | Impossible without skills or great effort                                            |
| 8      | Heroic       |    24     | A task worthy of tales told for years afterward                                      |
| 9      | Immortal     |    27     | A task worthy of legends that last lifetimes                                         |
| 10     | Impossible   |    30     | A task a even a metahuman couldn't consider but it doesn't break the laws of physics |

Unless a rule explicitly says otherwise, situational modifiers change the Rating (±1 per grade).

### Critical Failure: Glitching

Also called a Botch. 

When you roll a 1 if you succeed at your task the GM *can* give you a Minor Compel. If you fail at your task the GM *can* give you a Major Compel.


#### Critical Success

When you roll a 12 on your D12, you get an immediate Edge dice to roll and add to your roll for free.


### Effect

Effect is the most important part of Sixfinity. It measures how well you succeeded once you clear a Threshold.

- Success: Did you meet or beat the Threshold?
- Effect: The highest Rating your roll clears.
- Net Effect: The difference between your Effect and an opponent’s/obstacle’s Effect.

#### Net Effect

> This mechanic is unique to Shadowrun we do not care about Net Effect in normal Sixfinity.

Net Effect is calculated after a roll. It will always be the difference in two effect totals.

The GM knows the Effect (Rating Difficulty) of NPC's; You compare your Effect Result with the Effect of the GM. Subtract the lesser from the greater and the net result is the Net Effect. Minimum 1. The winner gets Net Effect. This is where Edge really helps you (see Edge).

Example: Bypassing a Maglock

- The maglock has a Rating 3 (Threshold 9).
- Your Intellect is 2, and Electronics skill is 3.
- You roll 1d12 = 4. Your total is 4 + 2 + 3 = 9.
-  That clears Rating 3 exactly.
- Effect = 3 (since you reached Rating 3, but not Rating 4).

#### Bonus Effect

Bonus Effect adds directly to your Effect total on a success; it is not an extra die. These do not count against your maximum Effect.

#### Roll For Effect

When the GM says: "Roll For Effect" those are usually the best words to hear in the game. It means you have pushed the Rating down to Rating 0 meaning you succeed automatically you just need to know how much Effect you had. A great number of things in the game require no roll at all, and most of the time you do not need to know what your Effect is but sometimes you do. In these cases roll `1D12` add all your modifiers and see what Effect you accomplished, you can spend Edge on these as well.

### Edge

Edge is a character’s luck, instincts, and ability to turn the odds in their favor.

- Edge Pool = (Agility + Talent + Tenacity) ÷ 4 (round down, min 1).

Spending Edge:

- Before rolling, you can spend 1 Edge. The most you can ever spend on a Test is 1 Edge.
- For each Edge spent, roll 1d6 and add the result to your test total.
- These d6s also increase your Effect if they push you over higher Ratings.

Refreshing Edge:

- Full refresh on a Long Rest.
- The GM may award Edge for clever play or roleplay.

Example: Shooting a Guard

- The guard has Rating 4 (Threshold 12).
- You roll 1d12 = 7, add Firearms +3, Agility 2 = 12 → you barely succeed with Effect 4.
- If you spent 1 Edge, you’d also roll 1d6.
- Let’s say you rolled 5 on the Edge dice.
- Your total is now 17 → Effect 5. That’s 1 Net Effect above the guard, meaning more damage.


### Advantage and Disadvantage
GM's use Advantage and Disadvantage as the terminology at the table to discuss lowering or raising a rating. If someone has an Advantage they thave lowered the Instead of fiddly modifiers, Sixfinity changes the Rating itself:

Advantage: Each level lowers the Rating by 1.

Disadvantage: Each level raises the Rating by 1.

Normally, only 2 levels apply in either direction unless stated otherwise.

Example:

Bluffing a guard:

Wearing a stolen security badge (Advantage 1 → Rating –1).

Carrying a rocket launcher (Disadvantage 1 → Rating +1).

Net change = 0; you roll against the base Rating.


### Success Tests
In a Simple test, you roll `1d12 + STATS + Skill`, and see if you meet total or beat a Threshold established by the gamemaster. The gamemaster establishes the Threshold based on the Threshold Guidelines and suggestions and guidelines established within the rules. If the the total is equal to or greater than the threshold, the action succeeds; in some occasions, the number of effect (the number on the Effect Result) comes into play.

Written as `1d12 + STATS + Skill (Threshold Rating)`

Such as `Agility + Firearms (2)` If you had a Agility DM of 2 you would roll `1D12 + 2 + Firearms skill`

This can also be written as `Firearms (2)` which has the same meaning.

This is a very important thing to understand - these are written as Difficulty Rating. 

NPCs and hazards are rated; players always roll vs. a Rating (GM sets Rating by Rating + situation). Net Effect comes from comparing your Effect to the GM Effect = Rating. Remember for PC's Effect is limited by Rating they achieved.

### Extended Tests

Simple and Opposed tests involve actions that are taken and resolved quickly, generally in the course of a few seconds. Extended tests take longer and are for more complicated activities, like repairing an automobile or building a backdoor into a Matrix host. Extended tests have a modifier and a threshold like Simple tests, but they threshold does not have to be met on a single roll (and often can’t be) as it is a threshold *rating*. The player can make multiple rolls of the dice,until they have accumulated enough total (totaling the totals from all their rolls) to meet or beat the threshold. With each roll, a certain amount of time passes. This time is known as the interval, and it is listed as part of each Extended test. 

Written as: Extended `Engineering + Talent (9, 1 hour) test`

### Individual Rule Sections

These sections are referenced in other locations in the book for how something works. This is the central repository for this information instead of scattering it all over the book in Combat, Equipment, etc.

#### GM Compels
The GM can introduce a Compel.

- Minor Compel: You still succeed, but something annoying happens (your pistol jams, your lockpick breaks, your code tripwires a trace).
- Major Compel: You fail and something worse happens (your gun’s safety locks, the door alarms, your deck reboots).

Whenever the GM delivers a Major Compel — or at any moment he wants to add a complication — you gain 2 XP.

- You may refuse a Compel by paying 1 XP, but then you don’t earn the 2 XP.
- If you have no XP to spend, you must accept the Compel.

As a guideline, the GM should use Compels once or twice per session per character — enough to make things interesting, not overwhelming.

This keeps the story dynamic: every bad roll can push the narrative sideways while still rewarding players for the trouble.

#### Range

Distance is simplified into four categories immediate, short, long, and very long. 

**Immediate distance** from a character is within reach or within a few steps. If a character stands in a small room, everything in the room is within immediate distance. At most, immediate distance is 10 feet or about 3 yards. 

**Short distance** is anything greater than immediate distance, but less than 15 yards or about 50 feet. 

**Long distance** is anything greater than short distance, but less than 30 yards or about 100 feet. 

**Very long distance** is anything greater than long distance, but less than 150 meters or about 500 feet. 

Beyond that range, distances are always specified as in 1,000 feet or 300 meters or a mile and so on. 

The idea is that it's not necessary to measure precise distances. Immediate distance is right there, practically next to the character. Short distance is nearby. Long distance is farther off. Long distance is far off. Long distance is very long distance is far off. 

All weapons and special abilities use these terms for ranges. For example, all melee weapons have immediate range. They are close combat weapons, and you can use them to attack anyone with an immediate distance. A thrown knife and most other thrown weapons are short range. A bow has long range. 

A character can move an immediate distance as part of another action. In other words, they can take a few steps over to the control panel and activate a switch. They can lunge across a small room to attack a foe. They can open a door and step through. 

A character can move a short distance as a minor action for a turn. 

They can also try to move a long distance as their major action, but the player might have to roll to see if the character slips, trips, or stumbles as the result of moving. 

For example, if the PCs are fighting a group of cultists, any character can likely attack any cultist in the general melee. They're all within immediate range. Exact positions are not important. Creatures in a fight are always moving, shifting, and jostling anyway. However, if one cultist stayed back to fire a pistol, the character might have to use their entire action to move a short distance required to attack that foe. It doesn't matter if the cultist is 6 yards away or 12 yards away. It's simply considered a short distance. It doesn't matter if the cultist is more than 15 yards away because that distance would require a long or very long move.

#### Key Concepts

**Action, Major:** Anything a character does that is significant, such as attacks, casting spells.

**Action, Minor:** Character actions like moving, taking cover, avoiding incoming attacks, taking attacks of opportunity, reloading weapons, etc. 

**Advantage:** Anything that decreases the rating.

**Character:** Any creature in the game capable of acting whether it is a player character, PC, run by a player or a non-player character, NPC, run by the Game Master, GM. In the Sixfinity system, even bizarre creatures, sentient machines, and living energy beings can be characters.

**Difficulty:** Synonymous with rating

**Disadvantage:** Anything that increases the rating.

**Edge:** Edge is a character’s luck, instincts, and ability to turn the odds in their favor. Comes in a pool that allows 1D6 to be added to a test.

**Effect:** The number on the dice which measures how effective you were at completing your task or test assuming you succeeded.

**Effect, Net:** The amount of effect left over after the reduction of the effect of an opponent or an obstacle.

**Roll:** A D12 roll made by a PC to determine whether an action is successful. Although the game occasionally uses other dice, when the text simply refers to "a roll", it always means a D12 roll.

**Rating:** Difficulty Rating is a measure of how easy it is to accomplish a task. Rating is rated on a scale from one at the lowest to ten at the highest. Altering the rating to make a task harder is called a disadvantage. Altering it to make a task easier is called an advantage. Rating often equates directly with levels, so opening a level three or rating three locked door probably has a rating of three.

**Round:** A length of time about 5 to 10 seconds long. There are about 10 rounds in a minute when it's really important to track precise time use rounds. Basically it's the length of time to take an action, a major one, in the game. But since everyone more or less acts simultaneously, all characters get to take an action each round and a minor action each round regardless of what their initiative is.

**Test:** Any action that a PC attempts, the GM determines the difficulty of the test. In general, a test is something you do and an action is something you are performing during that test. But in most cases, they mean the same thing.

**Threshold:** The target number you need to achieve in order to accomplish that rating of difficulty.

**Turn:** The part of the round when a character or creature takes its actions. For example, if a street samurai and an adept are fighting an orc, each round the street samurai takes an action on their turn. The adept takes an action on their turn and the orc takes an action on their turn. Some abilities or effects last only one turn or end when the turn is started.

#### Determining Test Difficulty

The most frequent thing a GM does during the game, and probably the most important thing, is set a test's difficulty. To make the job easier use the test difficulty table which associates a difficulty rating with the descriptive name, a threshold, and general guidance about that rating. Every rating from one to ten has a threshold associated with it. The threshold is easy to remember. It's always three times the rating. The threshold is the minimum number a player needs to roll on a D12 to succeed at the task after adding in their STATS dice modifier and their skill. Moving up or down the table is called adding an advantage or adding a disadvantage which is measured in steps. For example, reducing a rating five test to a rating four test is adding an advantage of one. Most modifiers affect the rating rather than the player's role. This means players only ever need to add the same things and not worry about modifiers.

Doing some quick dice odds with a 3 STATS and a 3 skill the player will succeed at Rating 2 without rolling. Which is why GM Compels were added to the game in order to make rolling risky, unless they are rolling for Effect.

#### Direct Neural Interface or DNI

A direct neural interface, or DNI, connects your brain to electronic devices. Direct neural interface (along with a sim module) is required for VR use, but DNI is also useful for AR in that you don’t need any additional gear like earbuds or an image link to see or hear augmented reality objects. How do you sign up? You get DNI by wearing trodes, or having an implanted datajack, commlink, or cyberdeck. And if you’re using a sim module along with your DNI, you can get a sort of “super AR mode” where you can also feel, smell, and taste your AR experience.

#### Grenades



#### TOXINS, DRUGS, AND BTLS

The Sixth World is a vicious place; it seems like something is always trying to do you harm. It’s not always a physical weapon, either. Sometimes it’s a fragging molecule or simsense program. Toxins come in a stunning array of forms in Shadowrun, some of them weaponized, some of them recreational. This section will deal with them. It opens with those toxins used primarily as weapons against the characters. Following those come the more recreational pharmaceuticals and their technological cousins. Then we finish up with rules and guidelines for substance abuse and addiction.

##### TOXINS


### If Players roll everything ... how does Effect work?

All enemies Players face have a Rating. That Rating determines their Rating Difficulty, Effect, even their Health. 

So a Rating 3 Enemy has a 3 Rating Difficulty. Their Effect is static it is always thesame as their Rating. So they would have a 3 Effect. Their Health is always Rating * 3. So they would have 9 Health. Their equipment and Armor are somewhat case by case but a fair way to do it on the fly is pick a weapon suitable and for Armor you can pick some or assume its the same as their Rating. 

For example a Lonestar Patrolman is Rating 3.


#### Lonestar Patrolman (3)
- Rating Difficulty: 3
- Dodge Difficulty: 3
- Threshold to hit: 3
- Health: 9
- Effect: 3
- Armor: +4 (Armor Jacket)
- Weapon: Heavy Pistol 4P DV.


## Chapter 6: Skills
// Locked for Playtest

When trying to accomplish something more refined than hefting a load, spotting an ambush, or running for cover, a character will normally use a skill. Shadowrun skills are groups of closely related techniques and knowledge, not narrow, limiting areas of function. 

Rolling skill tests is a simple matter of rolling 1D12, adding your STATS, and then adding your skill rating, comparing that to the threshold that you are supposed to achieve. This game does not attempt to recreate everything in life. Instead, it attempts to create the facsimile of life with a range of skills that cover almost every situation and using your STATS to show how, with their modifiers, they can contribute to success with a skill check.

### SKILL RATINGS

Skill ratings begin at a level of 1. The maximum rating for a Skill is 6. Starting characters cannot have a Skill higher than 4. Characters with no rating in a skill are considered untrained, but they may still attempt to perform a function covered by a skill by defaulting to an STATS by only using the 1d12 + STATS, some skills are inherently so complex you cannot use them without training.

### Active Skills

Active Skills usually apply toward achieving a specific, shortterm result such as hitting a target with a weapon, performing a difficult maneuver in a vehicle, climbing a wall, casting a spell, and so forth. These skills also involve some form of active, physical activity

### Knowledge Skills

Knowledge Skills give a character access to specific Information. This is especially useful when the character is an expert In a fleld in which the player Is Ignorant. 

Many Knowledge Skills also provide the character with the theoretical basis of actions related to the fleld of study and the basis for new designs In an area. Characters have their Talent * 2 in free Knowledge Skills.

**Languages**


### Defaulting

It is impossible to prepare for every scenario and only slightly harder to have every skill. When you perform an action without actually having the skill for the test, there’s still hope. You can default the skill, making the test using only raw talent. You don’t have any tremendous talent when you default— quite the opposite in fact. Characters with no rating in a skill are considered untrained, but they may still attempt to perform a function covered by a skill by defaulting to an STATS by only using the 1d12 + STATS, some skills are inherently so complex you cannot use them without training. Unless the gamemaster feels that you’re at a complete loss when defaulting, you can use Edge and better your chances by lowering the Rating.

### Skill Descriptions

#### Archery

Archery is used to fire string-loaded projectile weapons. An archer is familiar with many different styles of bow and multitude of arrows that can be used to maximum effect.

#### Athletics

Athletic skill governs exceptional training in a particular aspect of physical endeavors. Such as running, climbing, lifting, jumping, swimming.

#### Automatics

The automatic skill covers a specific subset of firearms larger than handheld pistols but smaller than rifles. This category includes submachine guns and other fully automatic carbines.

#### Biotech

Biotech skill governs basic medicine, first aid and implant operations. A character with this skill understands basic medicine in a hands-on sense, as a paramedic rather than a physician. Though familiar with techniques and materials of cyberware, a character with this skill would still need a computer expert to collaborate on the interface systems.

#### Blades

It slices, it dices, it'll even julienne fries. The blade skill includes the use of all handheld slashing and stabbing weapons. You can use a range of edge weapons including daggers, swords, and axes.

#### Clubs

Clubs governs the use of handheld melee weapons that have no edge or blade and are less than 1 meter long. This skill allows a character to use any short weighted item as a weapon, from a baseball bat to a tire iron to a chair leg.

#### Computer

The computer skill covers the use and understanding of computer technology and programming. This skill is absolutely essential to anyone who wishes to jack into cyberspace and run the matrix.

#### Con

Con covers the ability to manipulate or fool an NPC during a social encounter. This skill covers a range of confidence games as well as the principles behind those Cons.

#### Conjuring

The conjuring skill governs the calling and banishing of spirit powers. Only mages can call elementals and only shamans can call nature spirits.

#### Demolitions

The demolition skill represents the preparation, measuring, and setting of explosives.

#### Drive

Drive is the skill that governs the use of wheeled, tracked, or otherwise ground-based vehicles. It also includes such things as submarines, sailboats, and nautical craft.

#### Electronics

Electronics governs the use of an understanding of electronic devices, which is pretty much everything in common with a city in the modern age, such as mag locks, using electronic doors, bypassing security panels, and the like.

#### Engineering

Engineering is about making things do the things you want them to do. Making cars move, planes fly, boats float and machines spin and roar as they can achieve whatever purpose they were built for.

#### Etiquette

Etiquette represents the level of understanding and awareness of proper social rituals. The skill works as a sort of social version of stealth, allowing you to move unimpeded through various social situations. Etiquette also serves as a social safety net in case a player botches a social situation in a way a skilled character would not.

#### Gunnery

Gunry is designated for all progeto weaponry larger than an assault rifle such as grenade launchers, machine guns, and assault cannons.

#### Intimidation

Intimidation is about creating the impression that you are more menacing than another person in order to get them to do what you want. The skill may be applied multiple ways, from negotiation to interrogation.

#### Longarms

The long arm skill is for firing extended barrel weapons such as sporting rifles and sniper rifles. This grouping also includes weapons like shotguns that are designed to be braced against the shoulder.

#### Outdoors

While staying indoors forever watching trids and eating snacks seems like a good enough life. Sometimes you go outside. Outdoors is to help with those times. Whether you are following the tracks of someone or something, scaring up food, figuring out the quickest way to your destination, or even just which way is north, outdoors is the skill to use.

#### Perception

Perception refers to the ability to spot anomalies in everyday situations, making it one of the key skills a Shatter Runner needs.

#### Performance

## Chapter 7: Equipment

You’re only as good as your gear. It’s a common saying, but it’s true, especially on the mean streets of the Sixth World. Having the wrong gear at the right time or the right gear at the wrong time are both potentially fatal flaws. Either way you’re probably going to end up in a world of hurt, or worse.

One of the largest problems that the Shadowrun game has is an equipment bloat, particularly in the area of firearms. While it may seem fun to have a different name for every single pistol and every single rifle with multiple options, at the end of the day all of them do relatively the same type of damage and hold different sizes of magazines or clips or belt fed or what have you. Traditional Sixfinity and its derivatives tend to treat weapons as melee, which come in light, medium and heavy varieties, projectile, which come in light, medium and heavy varieties, in this case firearms, which come in light, medium and heavy varieties, as well as what would be considered heavier weapons which use gunry as a skill to fire. Those typically do not come in light, medium and heavy. These are types of tactical weapons that generally only do a very large amount of damage, but they can't fire very often and the ammunition is very expensive.

Speaking of ammunition, it is not typically tracked in a regular game of Sixfinity. Ammunition is treated as one of those things where if you roll a 1 on your dice, one of the things that may happen is that you need to be forced to do a reload in order to clear the glitch or botch. The reason for this is characters are treated as professionals in their field and are expected to carry enough ammunition with them to get the job done. Obviously there are exceptions, those being special types of ammunition like explosive rounds or armor piercing, sable rounds, that sort of thing. As well as ammunition for grenade launchers, rocket launchers, and the sort. Those types of ammunition are always tracked.

**Light Weapons:** Light weapons are always one-handed. They tend to do two to three points of damage, either physical or stun. Light weapons have Advantage I on attacks because they are small, lightweight, and easy to attack with. 

**Medium Weapons:** Medium weapons are heavier than light weapons. They can be used one-handed or two-handed. And they do four points of damage, typically four to five, physical or stun. These would be things like medium pistols like a Ares Predator pistol, Submachine guns etc.

**Heavy Weapons:** Heavy weapons are always two-handed weapons and they tend to do about six to seven points of physical or stun damage. Think of shotguns, long arm rifles, assault rifles, as well as Heavy Pistols such a .357 Revolver, that sort of thing.

**Very Heavy Weapons:** Very heavy weapons are difficult to wield, Machine Guns, Launchers, etc. They typically do eight to nine points of damage.

### Gear Details

The key functions of any piece of gear in Shadowrun are expressed in its game STATS. The exact categories of STATS depend on the item’s type. Cost is a universal stat—everything costs money—and all items also have Availability. We’ll cover that and some of the more specialized STATS.

#### Availability

Availability expresses how easy it is to find a piece of gear. The higher the number, the more scarce the item is. Availabilities typically range from 1 to 6, but circumstances can push them up to 9.

Note that the top levels of Availability are primarily reserved for alphaware, betaware, and deltaware versions of augmentations.

Availability ratings give a general sense to the gamemaster of whether player characters can find a given item, but they also can be used in mechanics in two ways. First, the Availability rating can be used as a threshold in Matrix Search tests to find someone who carries the item—though the gamemaster should note that just because the players find a seller doesn’t mean that seller will be easily accessible. Second, players may ask a contact to locate an item. 

Generally speaking, contacts can find goods whose Availability is less than (not equal to) their Connection rating. Whether they connect the player characters to the gear is a question of Loyalty and role-playing.

**Availability**

- 1 These items can be found just about anywhere. If you’re in a relatively civilized area, just walk a few blocks, and you’ll find a place that sells this.
- 2 These items are a bit more specialized, but that mainly means you’ll have to seek out a store that focuses on this type of merchandise, rather than finding it in your local Stuffer Shack or whatever.
- 3 These are starting to be boutique items, the type of things aficionados seek out, or things that are made in relatively small batches. They’re not the rarest items, but they’re also not sitting in a ton of stores across the sprawl.
- 4 Now we’re getting into specialty markets. These are things not intended for mass markets, and their specialized function isn’t for everyone. Few people in any given sprawl carry them, and their supplies are limited.
- 5 True specialty items. These may be collector’s items or things deliberately made for a niche audience, but they are not at all easy to find.
- 6 These are quite rare, often hand-crafted items. Small workshops and specialty manufacturers make them, and you’ll never find them at a major retailer. Work hard, and you might track a by-appointment seller who will sell you one.
- 7 These items are not available off-the-rack. They are specially ordered and custom-made.
- 8 Same as 7, but you have to make an appointment to order one, and you may be subjected to a background check based on whatever obscure criteria the manufacturer has decided to assemble.
- 9 The most rare items money can buy—you just have to find the person who will take your cash. Owning one of these marks you as a member of the elite, and selling one of them brings in extra cash due to their scarcity.

#### Legality

Some items are listed with an (I) or (L) as part of their Availability rating. The former refers to items that are illegal for private ownership in most places, which means they are only allowed in the possession of security, megacorporate, or government entities. The latter designation is attached to items that require a license in order to legally possess or transport them. Licenses are bought and attached to SINs (or fake SINs). The legal status of any given item is dependent on the local laws. What’s legal in the UCAS may not be legal in CalFree, or vice versa. The listings here are for the UCAS and Seattle in particular, as the UCAS has several laws (like gun possession) that vary by state.

#### Active Program Slots

This shows how many programs an electronic device can have running at a single time.

#### Ammo

This is the ammo capacity a firearm has, as well as the type of container—(belt) belt, (c) clip, (cy) cylinder, (m) magazine, (ml) missile, or (z) muzzle loaders.

#### Armor Rating
This is a reduction in damage from incoming attacks land.

#### Blast
This is the size of a blast of an explosive.

#### Capacity
Some items can hold modifications and other adaptations, and they have a Capacity rating to indicate how much they can hold. Other items take up this space—those items have a Capacity rating listed in brackets [].

#### Damage Value (DV)
This is used for weapons and is the base damage the weapon inflicts if it hits. It may have a letter indicating its elemental damage, such as (e) for electricity or (f) for fire. For explosives, this is listed at different ranges, including ground zero (GZ), Close, and Near ranges.

#### Device Rating
Used for electronic devices, this is a kind of all-purpose stat that reflects the devices overall power and systems integrity.

#### Essence
Used for cyberware and bioware, this shows the Essence reduction you experience when installing this item.

#### Modes
These are the firing modes firearms use.

#### Mount
This describes where an accessory is placed

#### Notes

If Range is important it will be in this section as discussed in the rules section. 

### Fire Modes 
Fire mode dictates the reload speed. Its based on the highest mode available. So a weapon that has SA/BF reloads as a Burst Fire. If it has SA/BF/FA it reloads as a Fully Autiomatic. 

#### Single Shot (SS)
Single shot weapons can only fire once per combat round unless a minor action (free action with a smartlink) is spent to reload them.

#### Semi-Automatic (SA)
Semi-Automatic weapons can fire at multiple targets per round at a Disadvantage per target after the first. Reloads on a Minor Action (free action with a Smart Link)

#### Burst Fire (BF)
Burst Fire Weapons can fire at multiple targets per round at a Disadvantage per target including the first. Against a single target they are at Disadvantage but the Burst Fire gets a Bonus Effect on a hit. Reloads on a Minor Action (free Action with Smart link)

#### Full Automatic (FA)
Fully Automatic weapons can fire at multiple targets per round at Disadvantage 2 for the first target, Disadvantage 4 for the next target and so on per each additional target. Automatic weapons get 2 additional points of Bonus Effect on a hit. Reloads on a Major Action (Minor Action with a Smartlink)


#### Size Cost Adjustments
Most gear is built to be used by humans, or at least human-sized creatures. Elves and orks are close enough to human sizes that they can generally make this gear work for them, but it’s not as easy for dwarfs and trolls. They usually need to shop at special stores or order their gear with certain customizations made to it. To account for this, dwarfs pay a ten percent markup on all the fitted gear they purchase. This applies to items like armor and clothes Size Cost Adjustments Most gear is built to be used by humans, or at least human-sized creatures.

**Using Unadapted Gear**

Sometimes a dwarf or a troll has to use someone else’s stuff or make do with what’s handy. Any time a dwarf or troll uses gear that is not adapted for them, they suffer a Disadvantage on all actions involving that gear. This means armor doesn’t close right, guns don’t fit right, commlinks aren’t easy to use, etc

Many items have a bonus applied when they’re kept attached to the Matrix. For the bulk of the population, this is just a little convenient aid in their normal life, but for runners it is often a door- die decision, because leaving your Smartgun XI linked to the Matrix could be the little edge you need, or it could be your doom as you get hacked and the fancy electronics-laden SMG becomes a paperweight. Items with a bonus are listed, and some have it listed for the entire category as well.

### Encumberance

Weights of objects are not listed because the game rules assume that how much a character carries is not tracked. If the GM determines that a character is carrying too much equipment though, he should either A) assign a difficulty and ask for a Stamina test, or B) assign the weight, speed, and Stamina cost to be deducted from the appropriate STATS. Method A is useful when a character wants to carry a single heavy object for a limited time, for example moving a hefty iron safe out of a bank and loading it into a pickup truck bed. Method B works well for long term encumbrance such as when a character dons a backpack full of survival gear, it sets off across the tundra.

#### Melee Weapon Descriptions

**BLADES**


Sharp edges provide the lethal advantage to everything with a blade. Brute force works, but elegant style is just as effective with objects honed to a razor sharpness.

**Combat axe**

Whether you’re Neal the Firefighter or Neil the Ork Barbarian, you can swing an axe for both utility and violence. The combat axe come with a single or double blade and a hardened spring-loaded thrusting point for breaking glass or providing an unpleasant surprise. In the overmuscled hands of a 2080s street warrior, this weapon can be far deadlier than a firearm.

**Forearm snap blades**

Don’t like getting implants but still want three razor sharp blades to pop out of your forearm? This is the weapon for you. The blades extend and retract through either a forearm muscle command. Either way, it takes a Minor Action. 

**Katana**

The iconic two-handed sword of the samurai is standard issue for trid-series shadowrunners. Out on the street, the deadly blade teaches lessons to those who think the trope is solely about looks.

**Knife**

A catchall term for a variety of different deadly fighting blades. The style is up to you, but the STATS are all the same.

**Sword**

A heavy blade on a one-handed grip that comes in a variety of styles. The world’s dominant combat weapon for thousands of years until the firearm came along.

**Chainsaw**

Normally for wood. Works on people.

**CLUBS**
These do stun damage, except metal does Physical damage.

**Club**

The STATS listed can be used for a range of objects, including an axe handle, baseball bat, crowbar, tire iron, wrench, or even a two-by-four with a couple nails in it. The price listed is for a professionally made, old-style police baton, but it would be relatively easy to find one for free in a pinch.

**Extendable baton**

This telescoping club can be extended with a wrist flick. In its retracted form, it’s easier to conceal (Concealability threshold 4 when retracted, 2 when extended). Retracting or extending it is a Minor Action. 

**Sap**

Also known as a blackjack, this is a short, flexible club or a leather-wrapped iron, lead, or sand filled sack for thumping heads. It’s designed to be concealable, often fitting in the palm of the hand (Concealability threshold 4).

**Staff**

Speak softly and carry a big stick. This is that big stick. Available in composite, hardwood, high-carbon steel, and other materials.

**Stun baton**
A riot-control staple and viewed as a symbol of corporate-government oppression, this handy electrical prod is still useful for everyone in the shadows. The stun baton holds ten charges and regains one charge per ten seconds when plugged in. 




### Thrown/Archery Weapons

Attacks using weapons in this category are made using the Athletics skill.

#### Projectile Weapon Descriptions

**BOWS**

**Bow**

Everything from the traditional longbow of fiberglass or wood to the modern compound bow. These archaic weapons aren’t common on the streets of {{YEAR OF GAME}}. They have the advantage of being hacker-proof as long as you leave off the fancy add-ons. Nocking an arrow takes a Minor Action (Ready Weapon). Bows have a rating that indicates the minimum Stamina you need to use the weapon. The weapon’s rating is also used to determine damage (maximum rating is 14). Arrows also have ratings, and they must equal or exceed that of the bow.

**Crossbow**

Modern crossbows are designed with autoloading systems, internal magazines that hold up to four bolts, and come in light, medium, and heavy designs. Light models are single-handed, while medium and heavy designs require two hands.

**Injection Arrow/Bolt**

The injection arrow or bolt causes its base damage while also delivering a payload of one dose of a drug or toxin. A successful hit must deal at least one damage after the Defense Roll. Injection arrows and bolts come at a base rating of 8. Higher-rating models are available for heavier bows, but lower-rating models aren’t sturdy enough to deliver this heavier projectile.


**Throwing Knives/Shuriken**

From stars to spikes and everything in between, these STATS cover all the muscle-powered, small throwing weapons on the market. Up to (Agility/2) of these weapons can be readied for throwing with a Ready Weapon action. Shuriken's provide a +1 Concealability bonus





### Firearms

Leadslingers abound on the streets of {{YEAR OF GAME}} (the name remains, even though lead rounds aren’t the norm anymore). For years, the streets managed to snag and use caseless rounds in order to stay clear of the law tracking them, but recent events have led arms manufacturers (a.k.a. the megacorps) to desire a tighter leash on their shadow assets, and cased ammo is becoming the norm once again, with each casing containing a microRFID to identify the weapon and location where it was fired. The glory of watching spent shells spinning through the air is back, and so are the back-alley reloads and scrubbed slugs to keep those of us in the shadows off the radar. Weapons are chambered for cased or caseless, with caseless ammo being marginally harder to track but tougher to find on the streets.

#### Firearm Descriptions

##### **TASERS**
Pistols

Tasers accept top-mounted accessories.

**Defiance Super Shock**

This heavy-duty taser can fire up to four darts with twenty-yard-long wires. The wired connection to the battery allows for a more powerful shock but limits range. It can also be used point pointblank in Close Combat for the same damage. After a successful hit, if the target does not knock the lines free, the attacker may use a Major Action to inflict the base damage of the weapon again by opening another set of capacitors.


##### **HOLD-OUTS**
Pistols

Hold-outs can’t take accessories or modifications.

**Streetline Special**

Designed for cheap 3D nanoprinting, the Streetline Special is made of composite materials, making it harder to detect with MAD scanners (increasing the threshold to detect it by 1).

**Walther Palm Pistol**

Walther keeps the double-barreled derringer with the classic over-under design alive in the latter half of the twenty-first century with the Palm Pistol. Capable of Burst Fire by firing from both barrels at once, the limited ammo supply only offers a six-shot capacity—so tread carefully how often you go with a burst.

##### **LIGHT PISTOLS**

Light pistols can take top- and barrel-mounted accessories.

**Beretta 101T**


**Colt America L36**

A tribute to Colt’s world-class reputation, the L36 is cheap, easily concealed, and abundant on the streets. In order to be easily transferred between corporate security rookies, the weapon feafeatures an ownership swap feature that has been abused by cops and crooks alike. A perfect throwaway weapon.

**Fichetti Security 600**

Designed as a light sidearm for security forces, the thirty-round magazine allows them to miss a ton and not worry about running out of ammo. This also makes it great for deckers. The Security 600 comes with a detachable folding stock and laser sight.

##### **HEAVY PISTOLS**
Pistols

Heavy pistols can take top- and barrel- mounted accessories.

**Ares Predator**


**Ares Viper Slivergun**


**Browning Max Power**


**Ruger Super Warhawk**

##### **SUBMACHINE GUNS**
Automatics 

SMGs can take top- and barrel-mounted accessories.

**FN P93 Praetor**

An unmistakable bullpup design offers a builtin fear response from anyone who sees these guns in the hand of corpsec forces. The Praetor offers an integrated rigid stock, a laser sight, and a flashlight with three settings to benefit low-light, thermographic, or regular vision.

**HK-227**

Heckler & Koch know how to design an SMG, since the 227 has been built off the same frame (the venerable MP5) for over a century. A top choice for corporate and military security forces, the HK–227 offers a retractable stock, integrated smartgun system, and an integral barrel- mounted silencer.

**Uzi V**

A new design for a new world. The latest model Uzi is a big market entry for Spinrad Global. The V model features an integral folding stock and builtin top-mounted laser sight.

##### **ASSAULT RIFLES**
Automatics 

Rifles can take top, barrel-, and underbarrel-mounted accessories.

**AK-97**

The AK-97 will never go out of style, especially since it still looks like its mid-twentieth-century predecessor. Built for reliability and endurance, it’s not the prettiest girl at the dance, but it can sure shake a tailfeather.

**Colt M23**

Cheap, mass-produced, and infinitely adaptable, the M23 finds its ways to the hands of everyone from gangbangers to pirates to delta-level government operators. The M23 can accept two additional underbarrel accessories for a total of three.

**FN HAR**

Fabrique Nationale is the name to fear when facing private security forces and corporate highthreat- response teams around the world. They made this weapon, which features a laser sight and a gas-vent system.

##### **Longarm Rifles**
Longarms

**Remington 900**

A high-powered bolt-action hunting rifle with a classic wooden Stamina. The base model is sold with a top-mounted imaging scope, but it cannot mount underbarrel accessories.

**Ruger 101**

Like futuretech in a hunting-rifle format, this gas-operated favorite sits in the hands of many professional hunters and hobbyists. It features a builtin imaging scope and a rigid stock with shock pad.

**Ranger Arms SM-6**

Ranger Arms knows what the SM line has always been about—silently neutralizing targets. This sniper rifle features a silencer, an imaging scope, a smartgun system, and a rigid stock with shock pad. The SM–6 carries on the line’s ability to quickly get into the action and then get out just as fast. It can fit into a standard briefcase; setting it up or breaking it down takes a Firearms + Talent (6, Major Action) Extended test. The SM-6 has dealt with the line’s fragility issues, and once put together it has no problem operating in any capacity.

**Barret Model 122**

Sometimes you need to shoot an enemy; sometimes you need to shoot an enemy through the side of an APC. The Barret Model 122 excels at tearing through metal and getting to the things it attempts to protect, ripping apart machines and vehicles with horrible tearing sounds that are music to the ears of the shooter. It has a silencer, smartgun system, and folding bipod.

##### **Shotguns**
Longarm

The STATS for these shotguns are for normal slug rounds. Shotguns can take top, barrel, and underbarrel accessories.

**Defiance T-250**

A solid street howitzer, this semi-automatic shotgun is available in either a normal-length or short-barreled version. It is gas operated and features a secondary pump action for situations where preventing jams is more important than quickly firing a second shot (clear glitch jams with a Minor Action). The short-barreled version has a Concealability threshold of 3, DV 3.

**Remington Roomsweeper**

Double-barreled and pistol gripped makes this little beast bad news when it slips out of a pocket. If you’re not a fan of flechette shooters, load some Heavy Pistol rounds into a Roomsweeper and she shoots like a really inaccurate hand cannon.


##### **Machine Guns/Assault Cannons**
Gunnery

Machine guns come in three categories—light, medium, and heavy—that determine their Attack Ratings. All, even the “light” ones, are bulky and unwieldy. A light machine gun is bigger and heavier than most rifles, while medium machine guns and heavy machine guns can only be carried by someone with Stamina of 3+ and 5+, respectively, since they are designed as vehicle- mounted weapons. Machine guns can take top, barrel, and underbarrel accessories.

**Ingram Valiant**

The Valiant light machine gun sits in the hands of mercenary units the world over. Basic equipment includes a rigid stock with shock pad, a laser sight, and a barrel-mounted gas-vent system.

**RPK HMG**

This heavy machine gun is used by militaries across eastern Europe and Asia. Usually set up as a vehicle-mounted weapon, it comes standard with a detachable tripod, as the RPK is best fired from a prone, sitting, or kneeling position when not mounted on a vehicle.

**SPECIAL WEAPONS**

Use the Exotic Ranged Weapon skill when firing these weapons.

**Ares S-III Super Squirt**

That name is terrible. Everyone thinks the Super Squirt is some kind of water gun, but it’s basically a glorified paintball marker that fires nonlethal dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) gel packs. The DMSO forces the skin to absorb whichever chemicals the operator wishes to deliver. The attack itself causes no damage, but when the target is hit successfully, the DMSO delivers the substance directly into the target’s bloodstream as a Contact-vector toxin (see Toxins and Drugs). The Super Squirt can accept top- and underbarrel- mounted accessories.

**Parashield DART Series**

Bringing down trolls with a little plastic, steel, and chemical cocktail for decades, Parashield sets the industry standard for dart weapons. The pistol model can accept top-mounted accessories only. The rifle includes a top-mounted imaging scope and can mount top and underbarrel accessories.

##### **Launchers**

The Exotic Weapons skill is used to fire launchers, and they can take top and underbarrel accessories. Grenade launchers fire minigrenades, and missile launchers launch missiles or rockets.

**Ares Antioch II**

The Ares Thumper is a remake of the old M-72 Grenade Tube Launcher complete with two barrels. Damage is as Grenade.




### Firearm Accessesories

#### **Bipod/Tripod**

A two-legged brace extends down from the weapon, allowing it to be fired low to the ground with the user in a prone or sitting position. A bipod can be attached to the underbarrel mount of a weapon and provides an equipment Advantage to the Attack Rolls when properly deployed. Attaching a bipod takes a Major Action. Folding up or deploying a bipod is a Minor Action.

#### **Concealable holster**

A small holster worn just about anywhere on the Stamina it can’t be seen, attached with a smart adhesive. It increases the Concealability threshold of the weapon inside by 1. Only pistols and tasers fit in a concealable holster.

#### **Gas-vent system**

Gas-vent recoil compensation systems are barrel-mounted accessories that vent a weapon’s barrel gases at a specific vector to counter muzzle climb. Once installed, a gas-vent cannot be removed. Gas-vent systems remove the Disadvantage from Burst Fire.

#### **Hidden arm slide**

Attached to the forearm and worn under clothing, this slide can fit a Hold-out, Light Pistol, or Taser. With a Minor Action and a specific movement, the slide moves the weapon into your hand. This makes get the weapon Ready a Minor Action.

#### **Imaging scope**

The classic top-mounted scope that includes a micro camera and vision magnification, Attachment or removal takes only a Minor Action. Having an Imaging Scope allows you to use the Take Aim Action regardless of Range.

#### **Laser sight**

This device uses a laser beam to project a visible dot (normal, low-light, or thermographic) on the target. This gives Attack Rolls Advantage 1, not cumulative with smartlink modifiers. The laser sight can be mounted as either an underbarrel mount or top mount. Activating or deactivating a laser sight is a Minor Action.

#### **Quick-draw holster**

An easy access holster designed to hold pistols and tasers. Use of the Quick-Draw holster provides a bonus Minor Action when the Quick-Draw Action is taken.

#### **Shock pads**

A shock-absorbing pad situated on the rigid stock of a rifle, shotgun, or heavy weapon. It decreases the Semi-Auto and Burst Fire Rating Penalty modifiers by 1.

#### **Silencer**

A barrel-mounted accessory for reducing the sound and flash of firing a weapon; not compatible with revolvers or shotguns. It increases the Rating on Perception tests by 2 to notice the weapon’s use or locate the weapon’s firer. Attaching or removing a silencer takes a Major Action.

#### **Smartgun system**

This is the firearm or a projectile-weapon side of the smartlink system. The system includes a small camera and range finder. It keeps track of ammunition and, through DNI, allows switching between gun modes, ejecting a clip, and firing the gun without pulling the trigger. The camera allows you to fire from cover, suffering no Attack test penalties while affected by the Cover Status. 

If you’re using a smartlink, the smartgun system gives Advantage 1 on attack rolls across all available range categories. Additionally it makes reloading 1 Action type cheaper (Major -> Minor -> Free). 

The smartgun features are accessed either by universal access port cable to an imaging device (like glasses, goggles, or a datajack for someone with cybereyes). Internal smartgun systems add 500 nuyen to the weapon price. 

An external smartgun system can be attached to the top mount or underbarrel mount with an `Engineering + Talent (4, 1 hour)` Extended Test.

#### **Spare clip**

This is an unloaded standard magazine for a specific selected weapon.

**All Things That Go BOOM!**

Some days, you want to make things blow up real good. Okay, make that most days. Anyway, here are some ways to blow a little select portion of the world to smithereens.

**Grenades**

Grenades are small, self-contained explosive packages. Boom and shrapnel all in one neat and deadly little cluster! Minigrenades are specifically designed for use with grenade launchers, set to arm when they have traveled five yards and explode on impact or with an airburst link. The five-yard safety feature can be disabled with an `Engineering + Talent (4, 5 Minutes) Extended Test`. Minigrenades have the same effects as standard grenades.

The damage from grenades becomes less the farther away from them you are. The DV entry for grenades lists the initial damage for those closest to the grenade, within a yard, called Ground Zero, then two categories of lesser damage for those in Close and Near Range, with the damage limited to a maximum range of the Blast STATS. Use the `Athletics skill + Agility` when throwing grenades, or `Exotic Weapons (Launcher) + Agility` when launching a grenade from a grenade launcher. Follow the rules for Blast Attacks. Grenades and similar explosives can also be rigged with a tripwire to be set up as a basic booby trap. This requires an `Engineering + Talent (8, 1 Major Action) Extended Test`. 
**Stun grenade**

Often called flash-bangs, these grenades explode to create a bright, loud, shocking blast that stuns and staggers anyone in their range. Along with the damage, those in the Blast of a Stun grenade suffer the Blinded I, Deafened I, and Dazed Status Effect.

**Flash-pak**

This is an electronic box, ten centimeters by ten centimeters on its face and two centimeters thick, containing a set of micro-flashes on each side designed to fire in random strobing sequence to confuse opponents. Anyone in the range of a flash-pak and using standard vision receives the Blinded status (p. 51) indicated in the DV chart on all tests that include vision due to the strobe effect. Using low-light causes the status to shift up one level. Flare compensation drops the status down one level. The flash-pak has ten charges and uses one charge per combat round. Plugged in, it recharges one charge every ten seconds. 

**Fragmentation**

The classic grenade, designed to launch deadly shrapnel over a large area.

**High explosive**

These grenades are designed to deliver a powerful blast but over a smaller space.

**Gas**

Any chemical or toxin payload can be chosen (Toxins and Drugs). The cloud lasts for approximately 10 combat rounds, based on the Gas Attack rules.

**Smoke/thermal smoke**

Similar to the gas grenade, a smoke grenade releases a cloud of smoke instead of toxic gas. The cloud obscures vision, inflicting the Blinded I Status for anyone acting through the smoke and Blinded II for anyone trying to act from within the smoke. The cloud lasts for approximately 10 combat rounds based on the Gas Attack rules.

Missiles are rockets that carry internal guidance systems, with sensor packages adding their rating to the attack roll, since they can adjust their trajectory in flight (also reflected in their Attack Rolls). Rockets and missiles are set to arm when they have traveled 10 yards from their point of origin and explode on impact or with an airburst link. This safety feature can be disabled with an `Engineering + Talent (4, 5 Minutes) Extended Test`.

As is the case with grenades, damage from rockets and missiles decreases the farther you are from the point of impact. The ranges differ based on the weapon, as listed in the STATS for each weapon. 

**Anti-vehicle**

AV rockets/missiles contain a shaped-charge warhead designed to burn or punch its way through a vehicle or barrier. Though the impact causes a blast, it is limited compared to that of a High-Explosive projectile. Advantage Attack Rolls against vehicles.

**Fragmentation** 

Used principally against people, the warhead discharges high-speed fragments designed to tear soft targets. These rockets/missiles are very effective against unprotected individuals, but not great against barriers, structures, and vehicles.

**High explosive** 

HE rockets/missiles are designed to do heavy damage to a small area. Their blast pattern is similar to that of a grenade, but slightly larger.


**Conventional Explosives**

Explosives are primarily used to damage structures, but metahumankind has come up with many ways to have them hurt Stamina structures. You can use the Engineering skill to prepare explosives

A range of explosive compounds, both solid and liquid, are available to the construction industry for all their destructive needs. All explosives are bought as an Explosive Package with a set Rating that encompasses an amalgamation of their power and quantity without defining either. They cannot be combined between rating ranges due to the differences in compounds and quantities. This makes using them simpler

**Plastic**

These highly stable, moldable, and adhesive explosive compounds are military grade. They’re ideal for certain jobs, like breaching walls and are usually color-tinted to indicate the level of current needed to detonate them, from the black of magnetic- field induction to the chalky white of 440- volt industrial explosives. We say usually because some bomb makers like to dye their devices to throw off bomb techs trying to disarm their device.

**Foam**

Plastic explosives with the consistency of shaving cream, stored in an aerosol can. Perfect for spraying into crevices, and detonated the same way as regular plastic explosives.

**Detonator cap**

This detonator is inserted into a mass of explosives and set off either by a programmable timer or radio signal. Setting the timer takes a Major Action. 

### Armor
Only one type of armor can be worn at any one time with the exception of combining a shield.

#### Armor Descriptions

Due to materials advances modern armor can be lightweight, flexible, and concealable. Armor adds to Defense, and multiple items do not stack unless noted.

**Leather jacket/duster**

Synthleather is the norm for street types, and this type of jacket (waist-length to duster) never goes out of style. It even offers a modicum of protection.

**Actioneer business clothes**

This is the fancy armored suit popular among Mr. Johnsons, faces, and fixers looking for a little protection coupled with style. It features a concealable holster in the jacket.

**Armor clothing**

Lightweight ballistic weave makes these garments almost impossible to detect as armor. It doesn’t provide as much protection as real armor, but it comes in just about any style you desire.

**Armor jacket**

Available in all manner of styles, it offers good protection without catching too much attention. But don’t think of wearing one to a social event or government building.

**Armor vest**

A flexible-wrap vest designed to be worn under regular clothing without displaying any bulk.

**Chameleon suit**

A head-to-toe suit with a ruthenium polymer coating supported by a sensor suite, allowing it to scan its surroundings and replicate the images at the proper perspectives. You gain a bonus Edge when performing Stealth tests to hide while wearing an active suit.

**Lined coat**

This cowboy-style duster has been consistently popular on the mean streets of the world’s sprawls for the past fifty years. Besides being protective, the armored trenchcoat provides a bonus Edge against tests to spot items hidden underneath.

**Urban Explorer jumpsuit**

Designed for couriers, athletes, and freerunners, this is the armored version of “flats” but available in a stupid array of styles. Because they’re so hip, these jumpsuits include a built-in music player and biomonitor.


##### ARMOR MODIFICATIONS

Armor can be upgraded with a range of modifications. The Capacity of a piece of armor is listed in the Armor Table. Armor modifications have a Capacity costs equal to their rating; the Capacity cost determines how much you can stuff into a single piece of armor.

**Chemical Protection**

This modification protects the wearer against Contact-vector chemical attacks (Toxins and Drugs, p. 121). The special coating neutralizes the Corrosive status for a number of attacks equal to its rating.

**Chemical Seal**

Available only with full Stamina armor, the chemical seal is an airtight environmental control that takes a Major Action to activate. It prevents the effects of all statuses connected to Contact- and Inhalation- vector chemicals but can only be used for a total of an hour at a time due to the air supply. It also neutralizes the Corrosive status six times before it’s built in chemical protection is worn away and the armor no longer has chemical seal protection.

**Cold Resistance**

Thermal fibers and heat-retentive materials protect the wearer. The armor cancels the Chilled status a number of times equal to its rating. Once it has resisted the Chilled status a number of times equal to its rating, it is worn away, and the armor no longer has cold resistance.

**Fire Resistance**

Fire-retardant, nonflammable materials protect the wearer. The armor cancels the Burning status a number of times equal to its rating. Past that point, it is worn away, and the armor no longer has fire resistance.

**Electricity Resistance**

Electrical insulation and non-conductive materials protect the wearer. The armor cancels the Zapped status a number of times equal to its rating. Once it has been Zapped a number of times equal to its rating, it is worn away, and the armor no longer has electricity resistance.

#### Helmets & Shields

Helmets come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes and protect your noggin from trauma. Helmets have Capacity that is usable for accessories such as trode nets and vision enhancements.

**Riot shield**

The clear plasteel cousin of the ballistic shield, this one adds an electricity attack option. Use the Close Combat skill for the attack and attack characteristics of a Stun Baton. The taser shield holds 10 charges; when attached to a power point, it regains one charge per 10 seconds.


### ELECTRONICS


### Cyberdecks

When the corps cracked down on the Matrix, working hard to prevent illicit use of their pretty new system, the cyberdeck re-emerged as the tool for messing with innards of the Matrix. They are powerful devices in the hands of a skilled decker. The newest models look something like medieval bracers, only less bulky. They’re worn on the wrist and can project keyboards (or whatever interface the user prefers) onto the user’s arm, a nearby surface, or just the air around them. Some models have screens; most don’t. They tend to look like a block with a series of ports For more information about them, see Devices.

## Chapter 8: Combat

Combat Rating By Rating

1. Establish Positions
2. Determine Initiative
3. Take Turns
4. Move to next Round

### Initiative

Initiative = Reaction + 1D12 (+ extra +XD12 from augmentations). Order = highest to lowest Initiative total.

**Initiative Table**

| Initiative Type | Initiative Test                   |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Personal Combat | Reaction + 1D12 (+XD12 from gear) |


#### Timed Items & Initiative

Unless the item lets you set a timer (in which case the player chooses when), these items go off at the end of the player’s turn. If armed and thrown/placed this turn, resolve at end of this turn; otherwise at the owner’s next end of turn.

### Movement and Position

In combat, characters and NPCs are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand.

Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can constitute your entire move. However you're moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.

#### Breaking Up Your Move

You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after another action. For example, if you have a speed of 10 yards, you can move 2 yards, take your action, and then move 8 yards.

#### Difficult Terrain

Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains.

Furniture-strewn offices, rubble filled streets, treacherous staircases—the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.

Every yard of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra yard. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.

Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.

#### Being Prone

Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are prone, a condition described in the appendix.

You can drop prone without using any of your speed. Standing up takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to one third your speed. For example, if your speed is 10 yards, you must spend 3 yards of movement to stand up. You can't stand up if you don't have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.

To move while prone, you must crawl or use magic. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra yard. Crawling 1 yard in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 yards of movement.

#### Moving around Other Creatures

You can move through a nonhostile creature's space. In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature's space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature's space is difficult terrain for you.

Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can't willingly end your move in its space.

If you leave a hostile creature's reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained later in the chapter.


### Action In Combat

The Action economy of Sixfinity is more structured than the economy in Shadowrun. 

When the action picks up and the game moves into taking turns in initiative order, it’s good to know how much time is passing and what you can do in that time.

When you get to take a turn and describe what your character is doing, your actions are contained in a combat round. A combat round lasts for about three seconds of in-universe time. Everyone, player characters and non-player characters alike, take a single player turn within that round.

Each combat round, you gain an action allotment that you use on your player turn. Actions come in two categories: Minor and Major. The basic action allotment for each character is 1 Minor Action and 1 Major Action per combat round. Players get 1 additional Minor Action for every Initiative Die they have. Players can trade Minor and Major Actions, using a Major Action to perform a Minor Action or using 4 Minor Actions to perform a Major Action (possibly providing an extra attack in a single player turn). Each action has a note next to it indicating when it can be performed; this is either Initiative (I) or Anytime (A). Initiative Actions can only be performed on the character’s player turn during an initiative round, while Anytime Actions can be used at any time. Note, though, that in order to perform an Anytime Action, you must have an Action left. If you spent them all on your turn, you can’t use one later. So sometimes it pays to save an action for later in the round if you act early. Note that actions cannot be carried from one round to another unless that is specifically allowed in a rule.

Along with these actions, enough words can be spoken or conversation can be shared to fill three seconds; if there is any doubt about the amount of words that can be said, time it!

Every **combat round** a character gets:
- 1 Major Action and 1 Minor Action



#### Minor Actions
These actions usually take only a small amount of focus or a quick and simple thought or movement. A key point among Minor Actions is that they generally do not require a test of any kind. That doesn’t mean in truly dire situations where the pressure is on that the gamemaster can’t ask for a test to be made—it just means that usually, as long as you have the action available, you can perform the task by simply declaring the use of it.

- Move (I) – Move up to 10y. (1 per turn.)
- Take Cover (I) – Gain Cover I–IV if terrain allows. Increases rating to be hit by 1 per Cover Rating
- Take Aim (I) – +1 Bonus Effect (bankable; max = Tenacity; once per round). 
- Ready/Draw/Sheathe (I) – Ready or stow a weapon.
- Reload (I) – Reload weapon. (Smartlink reduces friction; same action.)
- Operate Device (A) – Toggle/switch a device via DNI or manual.
- Command Minion (I) – Command one spirit/drone; RCC can broadcast a shared command to many.
- Defensive Reaction (A) – Choose Block (melee: add Armed/Unarmed) or Dodge (ranged: add Athletics) to one Defense roll.
  - Applies to a single incoming attack; expires afterward.
- Opportunity Attack (A) – Melee OA when a hostile leaves your reach.
- Stand/Prone (I) – Drop prone or stand up.

##### Move (I)

**Effect:** Move up to **10 yards**.
**Limits:** You can take **only one Move** per turn. You may break up movement before/after other actions. Difficult terrain costs +1 yard per yard. Moving through a hostile’s space requires the size exception and counts as difficult terrain.
**Triggers:** Leaving a hostile creature’s reach **provokes an Opportunity Attack**.

##### Take Cover (I)

**Effect:** If suitable terrain exists, gain **Cover I–IV** (GM sets level based on how much of you is obscured: ¼, ½, ¾, full). Each level grants **A rating up in difficulty to be hit**.
**Constraints:** Attacking from **Cover IV** imposes **Disadvantage** to your attack. While attacking from any Cover.

##### Take Aim (I)

**Effect:** Gain **+1 Bonus Effect** on your **next** attack. You can **bank** this; it persists round to round until used or lost.
**Limits:** Maximum banked Aim bonus = your **Tenacity**. You can Take Aim **once per round**. If you take a turn without **Take Aim** or **Attack**, you lose all banked Aim. You can’t bank Aim while Prone behind Cover IV.
**Scopes/Vision:** If using a scope or vision magnification, the **first Take Aim** enables the device (no extra bonus), subsequent Aims stack as normal.

##### Ready / Draw / Sheathe (I)

**Effect:** Ready or stow a weapon or handheld item.
**Notes:** If you have **Quick Draw** (gear/aug/quality), you may Ready a pistol-sized or small thrown weapon as part of this action and **immediately Attack** this turn. Very small items can be Readied in bunches (up to **Agility** to off-hand) at GM discretion.

##### Reload (I)

**Effect:** Reload a weapon to full capacity if you have ammo available.

Refer to the Fire Modes section in Equipment if you need to know what kind of Action your weapon reloads.

##### Operate Device (A)

**Effect:** **Toggle/switch** a simple function on a device you can physically access or that’s connected via **DNI** (e.g., change smartgun fire mode, engage safety, open/close a maglock, switch commlink mode, turn cyberware on/off).
**Notes:** Complex multi-step interactions use **Operate Complex Device (Major)**.

##### Command Minion (I)

**Effect:** Issue **one clear command** to **one** spirit or drone under your control.
**RCC Broadcast:** With an RCC, you may issue the **same command** to **all linked drones** with a single Command Minion. Different commands require additional uses.
**Dismiss:** Dismissing a spirit is also done with this action.

##### Defensive Reaction (A)

**Trigger:** When you are targeted by an attack, **before** the Defense roll is made.
**Effect (choose one):**

* **Block (melee):** Add your **Armed or Unarmed Combat** skill to this **one** Defense test.
* **Dodge (ranged):** Add your **Athletics** skill to this **one** Defense test.
* **Duration:** Applies to a **single** incoming attack; expires afterward.

##### Opportunity Attack (A)

**Trigger:** A hostile creature **leaves your reach** by moving away (teleports and forced movement do not trigger unless stated).
**Effect:** Make **one melee Attack** against the triggering target.
**Limits:** You can make one Opportunity Attack per round; it costs no action.

##### Stand / Prone (I)

**Effect:** **Drop Prone** or **stand up**.
**Movement:** Standing costs **one third** of your speed (round up); if you lack enough movement remaining this turn, you can’t stand. Prone movement is crawling (each yard costs +1 yard; stacks with difficult terrain).
**Status:** Applies/removes the **Prone** status.

#### Major Actions

These actions take a bit more concentration or time to complete. Several involve a test of some kind, but some simply occur as long as you have the Action available. Just like Minor Actions, if there is no test involved but the gamemaster feels the pressure is on and one should be required, they have final say in the matter.

- Attack (I) – Melee or Ranged. (Rider: Multiple Attacks by splitting penalties across targets.)
- Use Skill (I) – Any non-attack skill use (includes quick search/assess).
- Cast Spell (I) – Cast (healing/damage/utility). Counterspell timing lives in Magic.
- Summon/Banish (I) – Summon a spirit or banish one.
- Full Defense (A) – Add Tenacity to all Defense tests until your next turn.
- Operate Complex Device (I) – Multi-step interaction with non-trivial gear/rigging; includes Rigger Jump-In.
- Interact (I) – Safely pick up/put down/manipulate objects not covered by Ready.

##### Attack (I)

**Effect:** Make a **melee or ranged** attack.
**Roll:**

* **Ranged:** `STATS Dice + (Firearms/Archery/Throwing Weapons/Gunnery) + misc` vs target’s Rating Difficulty.
* **Melee:** `STATS Dice + (Armed Combat/Unarmed Combat) + misc` vs target’s Rating Difficulty.
  **Hit:** Deal **Damage Value = Weapon Damage + Net Effect**; apply any damage-type riders (e.g., Burning).
  **Rider – Multiple Attacks:** You may attack **multiple targets** you can legally threaten (ammo/reach/arc permitting). Each additional attack raises the Rating by 1 per attack. Resolve each attack separately. Net Effect is calculated per target.

##### Use Skill (I)

**Effect:** Attempt a **non-attack** task that requires a skill test during combat (e.g., hack a door panel, stabilize a teammate, force a door, shove/grapple per table’s combat maneuvers, scan a room).
**Roll:** `Linked STATS Dice + Skill (+ misc)` vs GM-set Threshold Rating or opposed roll.
**Notes:** This is your catch-all “do a thing” action in combat time. Tasks that are just a toggle use **Operate Device (Minor)**.

##### Cast Spell (I)

**Effect:** Cast a spell (damage, heal, utility).
**Roll:** As defined in **Magic** (typically `Sorcery + 1D12`). Apply drain, effects, and riders per spell.
**Counterspell:** Reactions to spells (Counterspell) are handled in the **Magic** chapter and may be Anytime where appropriate.

##### Summon / Banish (I)

**Effect:**

* **Summon:** Call a spirit to your side (consumes services as defined in Magic).
* **Banish:** Attempt to dismiss or disrupt a spirit.
  **Roll:** As defined in **Magic** (opposed by spirit as appropriate).
  **Control:** Issuing orders after summoning uses **Command Minion (Minor)**.

##### Full Defense (A)

**Timing:** Declare **anytime**; takes effect immediately.
**Effect:** Same as Minor **Defensive Action** but lasts **until your next turn**.
**Limits:** You can only use Full Defense **once per round**. Does not stack with **Defensive Action**

##### Operate Complex Device (I)

**Effect:** Perform a **multi-step** or **precision** interaction with complex gear/vehicles/systems that goes beyond a simple toggle (e.g., **Rigger Jump-In** to a drone/vehicle, configure fire-control groups, perform a short hacking sequence on a door while under fire, calibrate a medkit to a patient).
**Roll:** Usually `Talent + relevant skill` vs Threshold Rating or opposed; see specific subsystem (Matrix/Rigging/Medtech).
**Notes:** Once jumped-in, continued piloting/commanding typically uses **Command Minion (Minor)** or further **Operate Complex Device** at GM discretion.

##### Interact (I)

**Effect:** Safely **pick up**, **put down**, **stow**, **retrieve**, or otherwise manipulate objects not covered by **Ready/Draw/Sheathe** (e.g., holster one weapon while picking up a dropped one, carefully place a grenade, sling a Stamina over your shoulder, open/close a heavy door, apply a stim patch).
**Roll:** Usually none; the GM may call for a test if time pressure, risk, or precision matters.
**Notes:** Use this when the fiction calls for handling objects with care or when multiple items are involved.

### Combat Round

A combat round is approximately 3 seconds long in the game world. During a single combat round, each participant gets an allotment of Actions to use on or around their player turn. The basic Action allotment for each character is 1 Minor Action and 1 Major Action per combat round. Players get 1 additional Minor Action for every Initiative Die they have.

Actions can be traded between Minor and Major, but there are restrictions. A Major Action can be used to perform a Minor Action, simple as that. A character can also trade 4 Minor Actions to perform 1 Major Action.

Characters may never start a player turn with more than 5 Minor Actions. If they would have earned more through any circumstances, that number is reduced to 5.

#### Attacks

Players roll all the dice in Sixfinity. 

Ranged Attack: `1d12 + STATS + (Firearms/Archery/Throwing Weapons/Gunnery) + misc` vs target’s Rating Difficulty.

Melee Attack: `1d12 + STATS + (Armed Combat/Unarmed Combat) + misc` vs target’s Rating Difficulty.

When attacked by an enemy: `1D12 + Reaction` vs attacker's Rating Difficulty. 

### Damage

Involved as they are in an illegal and often hazardous line of work, runners get hurt and get hurt often. What kind of damage, how bad an injury is, and how much it affects the character vary greatly depending on the situation.

Damage is calculated based on the weapon, spell, effect in Physical or Stun. You deduct that from your Health. 

Damage Value (DV) = Weapon Damage + Net Effect

Apply damage type riders (e.g., Burning, Zapped) after DV is applied.

#### Types of Injury

Damage in Sixfinity is defined as Physical or Stun. Each type of damage is tracked on a separate Condition Monitor.

##### Physical Damage

Physical damage, the most dangerous type, is the kind done by guns, explosions, most melee weapons, and many magic spells. Weapons that inflict Physical damage have the letter “P” following their Damage Value. Physical damage takes a longer time to heal.

##### Stun Damage

Stun damage—bruising, muscle fatigue, and the like— is the kind done by fists, kicks, blunt weapons, stun rounds, shock weapons, concussion grenades, and some magic spells. If something does Stun damage, the letter “S” follows the Damage Value. Stun damage takes a shorter time to heal.

### Healing

We’ve explained to you how to put the hurt on, so now let’s talk about getting the hurt off. Healing in Shadowrun is a mix of in-the-field first aid, miraculous magic, futuristic tech, and heroic speeds of natural recovery. Getting back in the fight is a lot more fun than lying in a hospital bed for weeks or months.

The first thing to cover is the order of operations for healing. Do you need to apply first aid before magic or after? Can you magically heal someone who’s already been treated by a medkit? The answer is simple: The order doesn’t matter, except that Overflow damage heals first. Every character gets multiple chances to get patched up before they’re stuck carrying around their injuries for days. The key here is how soon each needs to be applied. Details are under each description below.

#### First Aid
- Biotech + Talent (5 - Essence)

As implied by the name, this is probably the first aid you should apply because it has the narrowest window. After the end of a combat encounter in which a character was injured, they have 1 minute (20 combat rounds if another fight kicks off) to receive First Aid. To apply First Aid, a character needs the right tools for the job, in this case a first aid kit. Any test made without a kit suffers a Disadvantage, and no Edge can be spent on the test.

Make a `Biotech + Talent test against a threshold equal to 5 – target’s Essence`. If the target is one-hundred-percent natural, the healer actually gets an automatic +1 Effect added to what they roll. This represents the difficulty of repairing someone who has metal parts as well as those with organs not normally found in average people. Effect is used to heal 3 points ofStun Damage (**not including drain**) per effect or 3 points ofPhysical Damage or 2 points of Overflow per effect. Drain cannot be healed with First Aid. A character can receive First Aid only once for any single set of injuries.

#### Medkit
- Biotech + Talent (5 - Essence)

Medkits are more detailed. The patient must be connected to medkit monitors and diagnosed, after which they receive injections and IVs. After the end of a combat encounter in which a character is injured, they have one hour to be connected to a medkit or get medical attention from a trained professional with a medkit. If they wait beyond this period, a medkit will not help them. It takes one minute to hook up the patient, get the medkit to spit out a diagnosis, and begin treatment. The healing process takes one minute per 4 points healed (so, if the process is interrupted, you know how much they were patched up). Each time a medkit is used, it consumes one batch of supplies. Treatment cannot be attempted if no medkit supplies remain.

Make a `Biotech/Medkit Rating + Talent test against a threshold of 5 – target’s Essence`. If the target is one-hundred-percent natural, the healer gets an automatic +1 Effect added to their roll. Like First Aid, this fixes biological material, not machinery. Effect is used to heal 3 points ofStun, Physical, or Overflow Damage per Effect, but not damage from drain.

There is a limit to receiving a medkit treatment. A character can only benefit from a medkit once for any single set of injuries.

#### Magic
- Sorcery + Magic 1D12 (using Healing or similar spell)

The wonders of magic are many and great. Healing spells are some of the most commonly studied magics for those working on the streets. Some use their skills to earn a little extra cash patching up gangers; others serve on a runner team, keeping their partners fighting when the bullets start finding their targets. Those with hearts of gold work as regular street healers to give the denizens of the barrens a chance at a healthy life.

The good news about magical healing is it works at the speed of a spell—once the spell is cast, the effect takes hold.

Healing magic can mend both Physical and Stun injuries, but not those caused by Drain. The leftover taint of wearisome mana prevents the healing magics from connecting to that damaged tissue to heal it. As with medkits, net effect can be used to heal 3 points ofStun, Physical, or Overflow Damage per Effect. For more information on casting healing spells, see Magic.

A character can be healed by Magic only once for any single set of injuries.

#### Natural Recovery/Medical Assistance (Varies by damage type)

After all other options have been used, if injury remains, it’s all about rest and possibly some help from a trained medical professional (or just your team medic). Rest is simply defined as not engaging in any strenuous physical or mental activity—essentially, anything that involves a dice roll would break your rest. Medical attention offers a bonus to the recovery roll. If any person trained in Biotech is watching over the character for at least half of their rest period, the wounded individual gains 2 Bonus Effect to the healing tests defined below.

To heal Physical Damage, roll `Stamina (1)` once per day. Each Effect heals 3 points of Physical Damage after that day of rest.

To heal Stun Damage, roll `Tenacity (1)` once per hour. Each hit heals 3 points of Stun Damage after that hour of rest. A full 8 hour (Long Rest) rest will recover all lost Stun Health.

#### Overflow & Dying

Sometimes a hit brings you closer to death than you ever really want to be, and you’ve got some Damage Overflow to recover. These points are healed just like Physical Damage and need to be healed before the character can return to the land of the conscious. Note that if a character receives exceeeds their Overflow damage, they are dead and gone, beyond the reach of any kind of healing.

### Status List
The different statuses used in Shadowrun, Sixth World are described below.


#### Blinded I, II, III

Whether it’s flashing lights, some specialized chemical, or the pure force of magic, there are plenty of ways to make it impossible for shadowrunners to see. For the first two levels of this status, characters take a Disadvantage per level to all tests involving visibility. At the third level, characters automatically fail any tests involving visibility.

#### Burning #

The Burning status is the result of being hit with a flame-based attack. Once the initial blow has done its damage, you have to deal with the continuing heat and flames, and the parts of yourself that may be on fire. 

The status should be noted with a number that indicates the amount of Physical damage the character must resist each round while the status exists. There are multiple ways to remove this status. You can spend a Major Action and roll an `Agility + Reaction (2) test`; success means the fire is out and the status is removed. You can also jump into water to remove the status without a roll.

If you gain the Wet and/or Chilled statuses, the Burning status is canceled. Similarly, gaining the Burning status cancels the Wet or Chilled status.

#### Charmed
- A charmed creature can’t attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.
- The charmer has Advantage on any test to interact socially with the creature.

#### Chilled

When you are truly, damagingly cold, it seeps into your bones and won’t let go, and you can’t move as smoothly and nimbly as you would like. When you are Chilled, you get –4 to your Initiative Score and Disadvantage to all tests. This status cancels and is canceled by the Burning status.

#### Confused #

Colors, patterns, and weird ideas swirl around your head, keeping you from being able to focus, which makes your actions uncoordinated and awkward. The number after the status acts as a rating penalty on any test you take.

#### Corrosive #

Acids, bases, and other caustics eat into your flesh and don’t stop. The ongoing damage from these chemicals is noted with the Corrosive status, which comes with a number after it to denote how much damage the ongoing effect inflicts. 

This status can be removed with certain gear (like baking soda for acids!) and equipment. The Wet status does not necessarily remove it, as some chemicals continue burning the skin even after contact with water. The gamemaster can determine when enough water has been applied to remove the chemical in question.

#### Cover I, II, III, IV

Whether you hide behind a wall, a dumpster, or a Stamina, Cover is protection from hostile fire. It comes at four levels, indicating how much of a character’s Stamina is protected (one-quarter, onehalf, three quarters, or all). A character in Cover gets a an Advantage to their to hit Rating per level. Attacking from Cover requires an extra Minor Action in order to get clear enough to take a shot, imposes a Disadvantage penalty to your attack at Cover IV.

#### Dazed

One too many thumps to the head, or maybe the solar plexus, leaves the character woozy and unable to act with their normal alacrity. The character reduces their Initiative Score by –4, and they cannot gain or spend Edge as long as they have this Status.

#### Deafened I, II, III

Whether you heard a sudden, hugely loud clap, or someone stuffed your ears full of cotton-like mana, sound waves are not getting through so that your brain can tell you what they mean. For the first two levels of this status, characters take a Disadvantage penalty per level to all tests involving hearing. At the third level, characters automatically fail any tests involving hearing.

#### Fatigued I, II, III

At its top level, this status is that dreamlike weariness, where your legs are lead and just will. Not. Move. Characters with this status take a Disadvantage per level to all tests. Characters move at 5 yards per turn instead of 10 for walking, and 10 instead of 15 for sprinting.

#### Frightened

Something has hit your lizard brain, and rational thought flees. All you have left is fear. Characters take a two rating penalty to any tests directed to or defending against the source of the effect. They also cannot move toward the source of their fear. 

#### Hazed

Something has messed up your connection to the astral world, leaving that realm out of your reach. Or worse, if you were already astral, you’re stuck there. A character with this status is unable to move between the astral plane and the physical world. They cannot astrally project or manifest. They may still perceive astrally.

#### Hobbled

Any movement on foot—Move or Stand/Prone—costs double distance (round up).

#### Immobilized

Just what it sounds like! Characters with this status cannot move, though they can take any actions that will function with their feet stuck to the ground. They take a Disadvantage on all attack rolls and cannot add Reaction to Defense rolls.

#### Incapacitated
- An incapacitated creature can’t take actions or reactions.

#### Invisible #

The go-to status for sneak thieves. Characters are less visible to living and sentient beings. The number after the status indicates the threshold rating people must hit on a Perception test to notice the character with this status. Cameras and other inorganic methods of visibility detection can see someone with this status as normal.

#### Invisible (Improved) #

The same as Invisibility, but it also affects camera and other technological ways of seeing.

#### Nauseated

Your stomach heaves, your head spins, and you have trouble thinking about anything other than not throwing up. Characters must pass a `Stamina (2)` test at the start of a combat round. If they fail, they cannot take an action that round. If they succeed, they can act, but they lose a Minor Action.

#### Panicked

The drek has hit the fan, and it has splattered everywhere, and you have lost the ability to act in any sort of a coherent fashion. Characters with this status cannot act except to avoid the condition that is causing the Panicked effect.

#### Petrified

There is a good reason why you don’t want to be in the wrong end of a basilisk stare, and this is it. The character is essentially turned into solid material. They cannot take any actions, and they get a +10 Defense Rating (reducing their damage by 10). This cancels any other damaging statuses the character may have been experiencing.

#### Poisoned #

Something wrong has gotten into the character’s Stamina, and it’s going to mess them up until it works its way through. This status has a damage code after it, with a number and an indication for either Physical or Stun damage. At the end of each combat round when this status exists, the character must take the damage. The damage decreases by 1 each round. Antidotes, both physical and magical, can remove this status.

#### Prone

One of the classics—you drop to the ground to get a stable shot and make yourself tougher to shoot. The character’s movement rate is reduced to 2 yards and they cannot Move more than once per turn while Prone. They get Advantage Defense vs. ranged and Disadvantage Defense to melee. Advantage attack rolls with firearms and projectile weapons (not bows)..

#### Silent #

Your ability to make noise is greatly hindered. The number after the status indicates the threshold rating people must hit on a Perception test to hear the character with this status. Microphones and other inorganic methods of audio detection can pick up sounds of someone with this status as normal.

#### Silent (Improved) #
The same as Silent, except microphones and other forms of technology are also affected.

#### Stunned
- A stunned creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can’t move, and can speak only falteringly.
- The creature automatically Disadvantage to the Defense roll

#### Unconscious
- An Unconscious character is Incapacitated, can’t move or speak, and is unaware of their surroundings.
- The character drops whatever they’re holding and falls Prone.
- Any attack that hits the character is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet.

#### Wet

Whether it’s a pouring rain, a sudden wave, or the efforts of a rampaging water spirit, you are soaked from head to toe. You take double damage from cold and electricity damage. Cancels the Burning status, is canceled by the Burning status, and may affect the Corrosive status.

#### Zapped

A jolt of electrical power has hit you, leaving you fried and scattered. Your muscles aren’t working quite right, either. Suffer –2 Initiative, cannot Take Aim this round., and Disadvantage to all actions for 2 rounds.

### Damage Types

Certain weapons and attacks deliver damage besides simple kinetic energy transfer. These forms of attacks, such as flamethrowers, fireballs, lightning bolts, tasers, and toxic waves to name a few, usually have a secondary and/or extended Status effect beyond the initial attack and damage result.

#### Electricity

Getting zapped not only hurts, but it also seizes muscles and leaves a victim shaky from muscle tremors. If a character shakes off the damage, they’re all good, but if any damage gets through (≥1), apply Zapped for 2 rounds.

#### Chemical (acids, bases, caustics, etc.) 

Attacks that involve corrosive chemicals—acids, bases, caustics, toxins, etc.—tend to stick around and cause damage on subsequent rounds. Chemical attacks add the Corrosive status. Additionally, if the modified Damage Value of an attack exceeds the Armor of the target, the Defense boost from that piece of armor is permanently decreased by one after the attack is resolved.

#### Cold

No one likes being cold. The shakes, chattering teeth, hypothermia, and tissue damage are just a few reasons your life will be harder after you get hit by a cold-based attack. Taking damage from an attack with a Cold damage type inflicts the Chilled status for 3 combat rounds. Lastly, if the modified Damage Value of an attack exceeds the Armor of the target, the Defense boost from that piece of armor is permanently decreased by one after the attack is resolved.

#### Fire

Once you’re hit by an attack that involves fire, the fire ignites flammable objects, including you. This effect means the fire burns for several rounds after the first. Taking damage from an attack with a Fire damage type inflicts the Burning status.

Gamemaster note: The damage and duration are subject to your discretion if the target has some mitigating circumstance. If they’re covered in oil or wearing a lot of loose-fitting cloth, it may last longer, cause more damage, or require a higher threshold to extinguish.



## Chapter 9: Magic

### Spells

When people think of magic, they tend to think of spells first. Spells are the process that makes magic happen, the channeling of magic into an effect that stops the world in its tracks— or keeps you from being noticed at all. This is how they work.

### Learning Spells

New spells, rituals, or alchemical preparations can be learned by studying spell formulae or finding some mentor (either a spirit or another Awakened individual) to teach you. Some magicians may be lucky enough to have a library of collected scrolls and grimoires passed down from previous generations. They also could have an Awakened family member teach them a new spell. For the rest of the Awakened, there are online communities such as SpellSource and Magicknet that hold collections of formulae submitted from various traditions. These networks are generally supported by one or more corporations, meaning that in order to use it, you’ll need have a legal SIN and a license to practice magic. Or good fakes. Established magicians sometimes work in the grey area of teaching unlicensed magicians, picking up a little extra nuyen by passing on knowledge to someone not quite as experienced.

Once you have access to a magical lodge and either a formula or a teacher for the spell you want, you’re ready to try to learn the spell. Make a Learning test, which is a (Sorcery or Enchanting, depending on the type of formula) + Intuition test. The time you need to learn the spell is equal to twelve days divided by the number of hits you get. If you have a teacher, they can make an Instruction test (p. 96) to add extra dice to your Learning test. At the end of the study time, spend 5 Karma to learn the formula for the spell, ritual, or alchemical preparation.

All injury modifiers apply, as do distractions from sustaining spells, poor conditions, and so forth. If your formula or teacher is of a different tradition than you, you take a –4 penalty to the Learning test.

While learning the spell, you must devote eight hours of each day to studying it, otherwise you fail and must start all over. If you get no hits on the Learning test, you fail. If you do end up failing, no Karma is spent, but any money you spent on instruction is gone.

### Casting Spells

Casting a spell has three primary steps (note that Combat spells add a step before these three):

1. Adjust the spell;
2. Roll a Spellcasting test (Sorcery + Magic); and
3. Deal with drain.

#### Adjust the spell

The maximum number of adjustments that can be made is equal to Magic or Sorcery, whichever is higher.

**Amp Up**: This is for Combat spells only. For each point of base damage the caster wants to add to a Combat spell, increase the drain of that casting by 2.

**Increase Area**: Area-effect spells have a base effect of a sphere with a two-meter radius. For each increase of 2 meters in the radius of the area of effect, increase the drain of the casting by 1.

**Shift Area**: This can only be done with certain area-effect spells. The caster can shift the area a sustained spell is affecting to another area within spell range. Spells that can have the area shifted are noted in the spell description. This requires a Minor Action and can be done any time. It does not cause drain.

#### Roll the Spellcasting test

The Spellcasting test is Sorcery + Magic; the number of hits needed and/or the opposed roll are described in the Spell Descriptions

#### Deal with drain

Each spell has a Drain Value, which may be increased by any adjustments the caster makes. The caster rolls Tenacity + their tradition attribute Talent for hermetic mages, Social for shamans—and compares the hits to the Drain Value of the cast spell. If the hits are equal to or greater than the Drain Value, the drain has no effect. If the Drain Value is higher than the hits, the caster experiences Stun damage equal to the difference between hits and Drain Value. If the damage after the resistance test is higher than the caster’s Magic, the damage becomes Physical. Drain damage cannot be healed by magic or medkits.

#### Spell Descriptions

Shadowrun spells have the following elements:

**Category**: Spells in Shadowrun are divided into five categories: Combat, Detection, Health, Illusion, and Manipulation. Spells are listed according to their category, since there are commonalities throughout the category.

**Range**: This is either Touch, meaning the target needs to be touched (succeed on an additional unarmed Close Combat attack that deals no damage prior to casting the spell, and subtract the target’s Armor rating from their Defense Rating for this attack); LOS, meaning the caster needs a physical sight line to the target (optical lenses such as binoculars count as physical line of sight; magical effects and digitized images such as thermographic goggles do not); LOS(A) means the spell has a line of sight range and also has an area effect, which starts at a two-meter-radius sphere; Special means the range is defined in the write-up of the spell.

**Duration**: This describes how long the spell lasts. It is usually Instantaneous (I), meaning it takes effect and then immediately dissipates; Sustained (S), meaning the effect lasts as long as the caster keeps it in operation (dropping a sustained spell requires no use of an action; the magician simply stops holding it); Limited (L) means the spell has a set endpoint that the spell cannot be sustained beyond, but it can be dropped earlier than that if desired (the standard penalties for Sustained spells apply); and Permanent (P), meaning the effect does not dissipate and stays in place without any effort or focus on the part of the caster—the spell becomes a full part of the world.

**Type**: This is either M (for mana) or P (for physical). Mana spells interact solely with the astral plane; they may affect living beings, as living beings have an astral component, but they have no effect on nonliving, non-astral entities. Physical spells only affect the physical realm.

**Drain Value (DV)**: This is the base value that casters must resist to avoid experiencing drain. It can be increased if casters use Amp Up or Increase Area to adjust their spells.

These are characteristics of every spell; each category may add other characteristics, which are described under each category’s heading.

### Sustained Costs

Magic is wearying and requires concentration, so if you are trying to keep a spell running while doing other things, there will be a price to pay due to the concentration and energy spent maintaining the spell. Whenever a spellcaster is sustaining a spell, they take a 1 Disadvantage to any action test for each spell they sustain.

### Combat Spells

Simply put, Combat spells bring the pain. They’re what you cast to make enemies scared, unconscious, or dead.

Combat spells add a step after the first spellcasting step, something that should happen after targets have been selected. Once the targets are known, compare the Attack Rating and Defense Rating to see if either side gains Edge. In the case of multiple targets, use the highest Defense Rating to determine if Edge is awarded. A caster’s Attack Rating is Magic + their tradition attribute; Defense Ratings are as normal, depending on if the defender is on the material plane or astral plane.

There are two essential kinds of Combat spells: Direct and Indirect.

## Chapter 10: The Matrix (Slimline)

When in the Matrix your own Talent is not nearly as important as the rating of your Cyberdeck.


### The Elevator Pitch

The Matrix is everywhere—cameras, doors, drones, host systems. As a decker (or a teammate with the right gear), you interact with it using the **same round structure and actions** as physical combat:

* **Action economy:** 1 **Major** + 1 **Minor** per round (plus extra Minors from initiative dice, as usual).
* **Initiative:** `Cyberdeck Rating + 1D12 (+XD12 from gear)`
* **Tests:** You roll **Skill + STATS** vs the target’s **Defense**. Success gives you what you want. Failing Detection pushes up your **Overwatch Score (OS)** until **Convergence** ends the party.

This chapter tells you **what to roll**, **what you can do**, **what pushes OS**, and **how IC fights back**—all with the same mechanics you already know from combat and magic.

---

### What You Need (Players)

* **Tools**
  * **Cyberdeck:** Grants **Attack** and **Sleaze** , **Data Processing**, **Firewall**, and **Program Slots** (see Equipment chapter).
  * **Cable (direct)** or **wireless** link to target. (Direct cable ignores Noise.)
* **Core skill:** **Computers**

**ASDF at a glance**
- Attack: Attacking Hosts, and IC. `1D12 + Attack + Computers vs. Rating`
- Sleaze: Bypassing systems, being Stealthy. `1D12 + Sleaze + Computers vs Rating`
- Data Processing: Working with Data, Files, Interfacing. `1D12 + Data Processing + Computers vs Rating`
- Firewall: Defense - Reduces incoming damage by Firewall Amount.

---

### Targets (GMs)

Everything you hack is either a **Device** or a **Host**.

#### Devices

* **Device Rating (R):** 1–6 (consumer to mil-spec).
* **Defense (most actions):** `Rating`.
* **Matrix Condition Monitor (CM):** `Rating x 2`.
* **Initiative (if it acts):** `Data Processing + 1D12` (often passive unless patrolled by IC).
* **Firewall** Reduces damage

#### Hosts

* **Host Rating (R):** 1–12.
* **Defense (most actions):** `Rating`.
* **Player Rolls Defense** `Rating`.
* **Matrix CM:** `R X 2`.
* **Initiative:** `Data Processing + 1D12`.
* **IC:** the host’s defenders. Deploy as OS rises (see **IC & Alerts**).

---

### Core Loop (Players & GMs)

#### 1) Roll Initiative

`Cyberdeck Rating + 1D12 (+XD12 from gear)`. Hosts/IC roll `Data Processing + 1D12`.

#### 2) Take Actions

You get **1 Major** and **1 Minor** each round (plus extra Minors from initiative dice, as usual). Your actions are below. Hosts/IC act on their turn using the same structure.

#### 3) Handle Detection & OS

Quiet actions require a **Detection Test** (below). Loud actions always push **OS**. If OS hits **40**, **Convergence** bricks your deck, dumps you, and pings your location.

---

### Detection

After any **quiet** Matrix action (Probe, Snoop, Decrypt, Analyze, Spoof, etc.), make:

**Detection Test:** `Computers + Talent` **vs** `Base Rating= Target Rating Threshold + your current OS` to determine Rating.
* **On a success:** you stay hidden; no passive OS gain this round.
* **On a failure:** increase your **OS** by **Net Effect**.
> **Loud actions** (Brute Force, Matrix Attack, obvious Control) **skip** Detection and **still** add OS (see below).

---

### Overwatch Score (OS) & Convergence

Track a single number per intruding persona: **OS**.

**OS goes up when:**

* You **Brute Force** or **Matrix Attack:** +1 OS per **Effect** rolled by the **defender** (not net).
* You end a round **connected where you shouldn’t be:** +1 OS **unless** you passed a Detection Test that round.
* You’re in **cybercombat:** +1 OS each round (no test).
* You use a **program** that says it increases OS: +1 per action affected.

**OS 40 – Convergence:** your last-used hacking device is **bricked**, you suffer **dumpshock**, and your **physical location** is flagged for response.

> **Check OS (Minor):** If you have **Baby Monitor**, you always know OS. Without it, you can ask the system as a Minor, but that requires a **Detection Test**.

---

### Major Actions (Matrix)

> These mirror your combat Major Actions—declare, roll, resolve.

#### Brute Force (loud login)

Kick the door in to gain **User Access**.

* **Test:** `Attack + Computers` **vs** `Rating`.
* **On hit:** You gain **User** access (read/watch/basic control).
* **OS:** +1 per **defender’s Effect** (no Detection Test). Triggers IC if present.

> **Escalate to Admin:** After gaining User, make another Major test vs `Rating + 2`. On hit: **Admin Access** (configure, lock out, purge logs, spawn/kill processes).

#### Probe (quiet login)

Slip in unnoticed to gain **User Access**.

* **Test:** `Sleaze + Computers` **vs** `Rating`.
* **On hit:** Gain **User** access.
* **Then:** **Detection Test.** On success, you avoid passive OS this round.

> **Escalate to Admin:** As above, but this second test is also **quiet** and requires a **Detection Test**.

#### Matrix Attack (Data Spike / Program Attack)

Deal Matrix damage (and maybe biofeedback).

* **Attack Test:** `Attack + Computers` **vs** `Rating` (or IC’s listed defense).
* **On hit:** **Matrix DV** = `Attack + Net Effect`. Target reduces DV by **Firewall**; remaining boxes mark **Matrix CM**.
* **Biofeedback:** If using a program (Blackout/Biofeedback), target also takes **Stun (Blackout)** or **Physical (Biofeedback)** equal to the same DV.
* **OS:** +1 per **defender’s Effect** (no Detection Test).

#### Control Device (obvious seize)

Take over a camera, turret, maglock, or drone for a short window.

* **Test:** `Data Processing + Computers` **vs** `Rating `.
* **On hit:** You control it for **Effect + Data Processing** rounds (or until contested). You can issue normal commands.
* **OS:** +1 per **defender’s Effect** (no Detection Test).
* **Limits:** You can control up to **Data Processing** devices at once.

#### Snoop (quiet tap)

Read/record a device or node’s traffic.

* **Test:** `Sleaze + Computers` **vs** `Rating`.
* **On hit:** You can view/record its traffic while connected.
* **Then:** **Detection Test.**

#### Encrypt / Decrypt File (quiet)

* **Decrypt Test:** `Data Processing + Computers` **vs** `Encryption Rating`. On hit, you read or remove protection. Then **Detection Test**.
* **Encrypt Test:** `Data Processing + Computers` sets **Encryption Rating = Effect + Data Processing\`** on the file.

#### Spoof Command (quiet one-off)

Impersonate an authorized controller for one command.

* **Test:** `Sleaze + Computers` **vs** `Rating`.
* **On hit:** The command executes once.
* **Then:** **Detection Test.**

---

### Minor Actions (Matrix)

* **Operate Device (Matrix):** Toggle/peek a simple control you already own.
* **Jack Out:** Log off cleanly. If **link-locked**, you can’t Jack Out.
* **Swap Program:** Load/unload 1 program slot.
* **Check OS:** As noted above.

> **Link-Lock:** If you’re link-locked, you cannot **Jack Out** until you break the lock (see IC) or win **Major: Attack (Break Lock)** vs `Rating +2`. Breaking out from VR causes **dumpshock** (below).

---

### Dumpshock

If you leave VR without a graceful switch to AR (forced disconnect, Convergence, or Jack Out while link-locked), you take **dumpshock**:

* **DV:** 3S (wireless) or 3P (wired).
* **Aftershock:** You cannot gain **Bonus Effect** or use **Edge** for `(10 – Tenacity)` minutes.

---

### IC & Alerts (GMs)

Use **four** simple IC templates. Skin them however you like.

All IC use **Host STATS** and act as independent combatants. Unless stated, they defend with `R + Firewall` and attack with `R + Attack`.

* **Striker (Killer/Blaster blend):**
  On hit: deal `R + Net Effect` **Matrix** damage.

* **Debuffer (Acid/Binder/Marker):**
  On hit: choose **Firewall, Data Processing, or Sleaze**; reduce that stat by **Net Effect** (to minimum 0) until the intruder leaves the host (recovers at **1 per minute**).

* **Control (Tar/Scramble):**
  On hit: apply **Link-Lock**. If the same target is hit again while link-locked, they must **Reboot** on their next turn unless they break the lock.

* **Black:**
  On hit: deal `R + Net Effect` **Biofeedback (Physical)** **and** `R` **Matrix** damage.

**Alert ladder (when to deploy IC)**

* **OS ≥ 10 (Alert):** Spawn **1 IC** (GM choice) on the intruder’s node.
* **OS ≥ 20 (Alarm):** Spawn **+1 IC**; **Control** attempts Link-Lock priority targets.
* **OS ≥ 30 (Lockdown):** Spawn **+1 IC**; **Black** may deploy.
* **OS ≥ 40 (Convergence):** As written—brick, dump, ping location.

> **Simple pacing alternative:** If you don’t want to track OS for a quick scene, spawn 1 IC the first time the decker uses **Brute Force** or **Matrix Attack**, 1 more if they do it again, and a **Black** IC if they keep pushing.

---

### Noise (Interference)

Apply **–1** per point of **Noise** to all Matrix tests. If Noise exceeds the device’s Rating, it cannot connect wirelessly. **Direct cable** = Noise 0.

Common sources: distance, dense walls/earth, water, jammers, spam zones. (Use the table from Equipment as-is.)

---

### Programs (quick list)

Your deck can run up to its **Active Program Slots**. Unless noted, effects are passive.

* **Stealth:** Advantage on **Detection Tests**.
* **Exploit:** Advantage on **your next** hacking action (declare first).
* **Armor:** +2 to your Firewall.
* **Browse:** On **Matrix Search**, gain **+1 Bonus Effect** (use now or lose).
* **Signal Scrubber:** –2 **Noise** (min 0).
* **Toolbox:** +1 **Data Processing**.
* **Virtual Machine:** +2 program slots; when you take Matrix damage, add **+1 unresisted** so no Firewall.
* **Blackout:** Your Matrix Attacks also deal **Stun** (biofeedback).
* **Biofeedback:** Your Matrix Attacks also deal **Physical** (biofeedback).
* **Overclock (Action):** Spend a slot to add **+2 Bonus Effect** to **one** Matrix action (declare first).
* **Baby Monitor:** Always know your **OS** (no action).
* **Rabbit:** Once per reboot, **reduce OS by 5** (Minor to trigger).

---

### Access Levels (what you get)

* **User:** read files, watch feeds, operate standard controls (open/close).
* **Admin:** reconfigure systems, lock out users, purge logs, spawn/kill processes, retask devices.

> **GM tip:** If stakes are high, require a second Major test (User → Admin) at `Rating x2`. Otherwise, grant Admin when fiction warrants (stolen creds, inside line, or great setup).
