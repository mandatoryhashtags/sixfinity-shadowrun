## What is SIRE?

SIRE is a 3d6 TTRPG system created by CJ Schrum to be a generic system used to play any kind of TTRPG. It was influenced by his near thirty years of table top games in nearly every ruleset created. 

> I used to play FATE I liked a lot of things about FATE, I hated FATE dice mechanics. I played a lot of Cepheus, Traveller, Decipher Star Trek, ModernAGE, West End Games Star Wars, and Sixfinity so lets say I have a lot of experience with D6 in my hands. So I set out to create a fairly generic style RPG using 3D6 (I like the curve better than the standard distribution of 2D6). Allowing for Advanatage Roll 3D6 twice take highest, and Disadvantage Roll 3D6 twice take the lowest. They also have Courage Points they can spend.
> Combat is meant to be cinematic in style with a tactical flavor. Characters have Physical Health.

## Chapter 1: Character Creation 
{{Write a Definition}}

### Attributes

There are eight attributes and two special attributes.

---

**Physical Attributes**

---


**Body**

The Body attribute determines a character’s resistance to outside forces. It represents the character’s cardiovascular fitness and endur- ance, immune system, how well she heals, her tolerance for drugs and alcohol, and, to some extent, her muscle and bone structure and weight. Low Body could mean a character is skinny and frail-boned or has bad eating and health habits. High Body means a character is better fed, tough as nails, has strong bones with some spring to them, and an immune system that won’t quit. Body does not necessarily correlate with physical size—a fat, out of shape character likely has a low Body, but a small character who is wiry and athletic may have a high Body.

**Agility**

Agility represents fine motor control—manual dexterity, flexibility, balance, and coordination. A character with a low Agility may be someone with an inner-ear problem, one leg that is shorter than the other, or a simple klutz. Higher Agility ratings may belong to charac- ters that are “natural” athletes.

**Reaction**

A character’s Reaction is, quite simply, her physical reflexes—how quickly she can react to a changing situation, and how well she can dodge the physical slings and arrows that shadowrunning brings. A character with a high Reaction is more likely to be on top of a situation and will be in a better position to react to danger, while low-Reaction characters will lag behind.

**Strength**

Strength denotes what a character’s muscles can do, including things such as raw lifiing power and running speed. Strength is some- what dependent on a character’s size and metatype. If your character is a 5’3” tall, 115-pound human girl, she’s unlikely to possess an un- augmented Strength attribute of 6. On the other hand, dwarfs have a muscle density that rivals that of reptiles. Characters with low Strength may be small, skinny, or slight, or simply too busy to work out. A high- Strength character may be tough and wiry, know how to use her body to her best advantage, work out every day, or simply be fraggin’ BIG.

---

***Mental Attributes**

**Charisma**

Charisma is a nebulous attribute. More than just looks, Charisma rep- resents a character’s personal aura, self-image, ego, willingness to find out what people want and give it to them, and ability to recognize what she can and can’t get out of people. A whiny demeanor, a me-first attitude, or an inability to read body language or subtle hints are just a few traits that can give a character low Charisma. A character with high Charisma might simply enjoy entertaining others, may excel at making friends and/or manipulating people, or may be all flash and fun with whomever it is today. A high-Charisma character might deliver jokes at the right moment, have a sexy way of carrying herself, or com- mand respect because her timing is always impeccable.

**Intuition**

Intuition covers “mental alertness”—the ability to take in and process information, to read a crowd, to assess a situation for danger or opportunity. A character with little Intuition may be unobservant, may rarely think things fully through, or could simply be “slow.” A character with a high Intuition is adept at making the best of a bad situation, knowing when to leave before an encounter escalates, noticing small clues, and working from instinct.

**Logic**

Logic represents a character’s memorizing ability and raw brain- power. It denotes how fast a character learns, how much she can re- member, and how well she can execute pre-planned sequences. A Logic-lacking character might get overwhelmed when confronted with a lot of details and may have a poor memory—especially for facts and figures. Characters with a high Logic rating will likely be excellent book-learners, able to deal with computer and magic theory with ease, and capable of building (and tearing down!) machinery and electronics. 


**Willpower**

Willpower keeps a character going when she wants to give up, or enables her to control her habits and emotions. Willpower determines whether or not a character is going to take charge of her life. A charac- ter with low Willpower might defer to other people when big decisions are being made, for example. A high-Willpower character is more as- sured and possesses a never-say-die streak. Such characters go down to the monowire because that’s exactly the fragging point. Willpower also represents a character’s cool under fire, her ability to resist intimida- tion and manipulation, and her resolve to stick to her guns when the
pressure is on.

---

**Special Attributes**

Please note Resonance is not used in Sixfinity if it is referenced ignore it.

**Magic**

Magic is a measure of the ability to use magic and of the body’s attunement to the mana that flows through our plane. Those with strong Magic ratings are able to hand e powerful magic and mana ma- nipulation. Those with weak Magic ratings are more sensitive and more easily drained by the use of magic. Those with no Magic rating have no magical capabilities and are tuned out from the magical realms. Serious damage to the body and invasive additions such as cyberware and bio- ware reduce the Magic attribute. Magic and Resonance are mutually exclusive attributes. A character who possesses a quality that grants a Magic of 1 or higher cannot have a Resonance attribute.

**Courage**

A character’s Courage represents that special something that can turn the tide and save the day—a successful gut check, a moment of brilliant inspiration or creativity, or a once-in-a-lifetime physical feat. Courage is a combination of luck, timing, and the favor of the gods. Characters with low Courage are unlikely to get unexpected breaks in life, much less win the lottery. A high-Courage character, however, is graced with good fortune and has an uncanny ability to succeed despite the odds. Courage can be spent at certain points in the game to help tip the odds in your character’s favor. Unlike other attributes, Courage provides Courage points that may be spent in certain ways—once used, these points are not regained until certain in- game events occur, at the discretion of the gamemaster 


**Essence**

Essence is a measure of life force, of a body’s wholeness. It represents the body’s cohesiveness and holistic strength. Things that are invasive to the body, such as cyberware and bioware, reduce Essence. If a character abuses her body repeatedly with chemicals, toxins, or even just negli- gence over a long period of time, she may lose Essence as well. Long-time drug addicts and chipheads who have done permanent damage to their systems have lost Essence. Lost Essence can never be regained (short of the Essence Drain critter power). When Essence declines, Magic and Resonance decline by the same amount. All characters start the game with an Essence of 6.

### Priority System

In Sixfinity character generation is based on the Priority System. The Priority System is a table with the following columns: Species, Attributes, Magic, Skills, and Resources. The rows are divided into Priority Levels ranging from Priority A to Priority E. Players assign a specific Priority Level for each of the columns to their character depending on their preferences. The values assigned must be different for each column (representing each aspect of the character), and there can be no duplications. For example, a character may not have Priority Level B for Magic and Priority B for Resources. The higher the Priority Level (A, B, etc.), the more valuable it is for the character. Characters use Experience later on to customize their characters even further.

The player begins the character-creation process by choosing their character’s metatype, or species. There are five distinct races within the core Sixfinity system, gamemasters are welcome to add or replace them: dwarfs, elves, humans, orcs, and fomori. Each species receives different racial advantages (and possibly disadvantages). Humans, for example, receive a higher rating in Courage (+1). Formions receive Thermographic Vision, +1 Reach (1 square), and Dermal Armor, but they also have the disadvantage of having their Lifestyle costs doubled to reflect the costs of adapting everything they use—especially their gear, to meet their massive physical requirements. Several species also receive physical or mental advantages/disadvantages to their attribute ratings (such as higher or lower natural attribute limits). When determining which metatype best fits the character concept they wish to play, the player should refer to the Species Attribute Table (below) and review the specific details for each metatype.

Once the player has selected the metatype they wish to play, they should review the Species column to determine which Priority Levels give them the best options for their character based on their preferred metatype and the special attribute points they need. The special attributes are Courage, and Magic; if you want your character to have a high rating in one or more of these areas, make sure you select a row with plenty of special attribute points.

Regardless of Priority all starting characters get 25 Experience to spend on their character to flesh them out, make then unique.

Final Touches and Derived Stats.

### Derived Stats

#### Defense

Defense = 10 + (REACTION + INTUITION)

#### Physical Health

Physical Health = ([Body / 2] + 8) x3

This is your Physical Health. If it reach zero you are bleeding to death. You will start at 0 and lose 1 point per round you are not stabalized. You can go into the negative equal to your Lifeblood. 

For Example Jared is hit by a Shotgun for 13. Jared only had 10 Physical left. So Jared drops to 0 and is Incapacitated. The next round Jared drops to -1, Jared has a Body of 5 so he can bleed until he is at -5 once he ticks to -6 he is dead. 

#### Stun Health

Stun Health = ([Willpower / 2] + 8) x3

This is where Stun Damage is recorded. If it reaches 0 you start taking Physical Damage and you are at Disadvantage to most Tests until you take a Breather (see Healing). 

#### Lifeblood

This is how far into the Negatives you can go before you die. 

Lifeblood = Body + Misc Bonuses

#### Toughness

Toughness = [Body + Augmentation Adjustments / 3] Round Up 

This is how much damage you can naturally ignore. It does not apply to Penetrating damage. 

Example: Sarah is fighting a Security Guard. 

- Sarah is hit by a Ruger Super Warhawk (9P, AP –2). The attacker rolled 3 Effect, for a DV of 12.
- Sarah’s Armor Jacket (10) is reduced by AP –2 → 8 effective Armor.
- DV 12 – 8 Armor = 4 damage left.
- Of this, 2 damage is penetrating and bypasses Toughness.
- Sarah’s Toughness 3 absorbs the remaining 2 non-penetrating damage.
- Final Result: 2 damage goes through.

#### Movement

Base movement for any character is 10 + Agility in Yards.

#### Initiative

This is used for Initiative it is also used for Passive checks. Initiative is pre-determined to speed up combat.

This can be modified with Courage, Augmentations, raising Attributes etc.

Initiative = Reaction + Intuition + 4

#### Courage Points

List your Courage Rating after character creation.

#### Limits
Limits are your Effect limits. No matter how well you roll. There are limits to the body, those limits will limit how much Effect you can apply to situations. Often times you will be more limited by your equipment than your body. Accuracy on a weapon for example, is a limit to how much Effect you can apply as extra damage.

##### Mental

[(Logic x 2) + Intuition + Willpower] / 3 (round up)

For example if you have a Logic of 5, a Intuition of 3 and a Willpower of 4 your Mental Limit would be 6.

[(5 x 2) + 3 + 4] / 3 = 5.667, rounds up to 6.

##### Physical

[(Strength x 2) + Body + Reaction] / 3 (round up)

##### Social

[(Charisma x 2) + Willpower + Essence] / 3 (round up)

### Character Advancement

In this game you spend your experience you gain at the end of the sessions to increase your charatcer during downtimes. 

Raising attributes is based on what the modifier not the base score. So to increase your Strength that is +3 to +4

| Desired Effect                                  | XP Cost         |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Raise a Physical/Mental/Magic/Courage attribute | Next rating X 5 |
| Raise an active skill                           | New Rating X 2  |
| Raise a Knowledge/Language Skill                | New Rating      |
| New Knowledge/Language Skill                    | 2               |
| New Specialization                              | 2               |
| New Active Skill                                | 4               |
| Additional Physical Health (BOD+STR)            | 10              |
| Buy or upgrade and Edge                         | XP Cost X 2     |
| Remove a Flaw                                   | XP Bonus X 2    |
| New Spell                                       | 5               |

Toughness and Defense, Physical Health, Reactions get recalculated when base attributes go up. You can increase the Misc. bonus to reactions with Experience. There is no option to increase Toughness or Defense characters can buy Armor and have other means to make themselves harder to hit.

Species in Sixfinity unlike many other games do not start with higher base attributes; instead they just have a higher potential attribute maximum.

Not all of these species are used in Sixfinity and none of them are required except humans.

Troll are most commonly found in the British Isles, with notable populations in Wales, Iceland and Southeast Britain. Studies suggest a possible genetic tie between Fomorian expression and Celtic ancestry, hinting that their presence may stem from migration rather than true regional nativity.

Averaging 7 feet and 500 pounds.


**Ability Adjustments**
- Racial Abilites: Thermographic Vision
- Toughness: +1 from Natural Armor
- Body Maximum is 8, Agility Maximum is 5, Strength Maximum is 8, Charisma Maximum is 4



## Chapter 3: Contacts & Allies



## Chapter 4: Rules

The rules center around rolling three six sided dice. One of those dice **must** be of a different color this dice is called the "The Effect Dice" this dice will add drama, excitement, and moments of unpredictability in the game. 

### How does it work?

Nearly everything is a TEST or CHECK. 

Result = 3D6 + Ability Modifier + Skill Rank

You compare this result to a Target Number (below)

### TN's

| Difficulty           | TN  | Threshold Stepping |
| -------------------- | --- | ------------------ |
| Easy                 | 6   | 1                  |
| Average              | 12  | 2                  |
| Hard                 | 18  | 3-4                |
| Very Hard            | 24  | 5-6                |
| Extreme              | 30  | 7-8                |
| Virtually Impossible | 36  | 9-10               |

#### Threshold
Threshold is just another way of saying, "TN" its the minimum Threshold you need to reach to achieve your goal. This term is not part of Sixfinity Core;
This was added just for SR5e, in some cases things call for a Threshold Reduction. This just means stepping the TN down.

So if something was a Threshold 3, it was a TN 18 and you reduce the Threshold by 1, it is a TN 12.

This means if something says it is a Threshold 3 then the TN is 18. 

> This is the behidn the curtain look at how I did this conversion. Normal Sixfinity these TN's are 5/10/15/20/25/30 I adjusted them to be by 6's because of the math I found when I started looking into the 1/3 success rate on dice. They consider 4 dice a guranteed success so I took the average for a D6 as 3 (rounded down) multipled it by 4 to get the "Average" then went half for Easy and scaled from there.

### Rolling 18
One of two things happen when you roll 6 on all three dice. 

1. If you succeeded at your test, you get to roll the Effect Dice again, once, and add the total to your Effect Dice for Effect.

2. If you did not you get to add the new Roll to your Total for the Test. **This triggers the Rule of Six.**

> Errata: In case 2 assuming you get a high enough Total to succeed at the roll your Effect is considered 6, you did after all start with a 6.

#### Glitching

Also called a Botch. 

When you roll a natural 1 on the effect dice; this is called a glitch or a botch. As long as you still beat the Target Number provided you are able to get a success. However, something will happen that did not go according to plan this is ruled by the Gamemaster but some suggestions are things like gun jammed requiring a Minor A ction to clear it. We treat this as a "Yes but..." siutation.

What if you roll a natural 3? In that case you have a Critical Glitch. Critical Glitches can be quite bad it depends on the GM a common rule during combat is that the gun is so fouled up it takes a Complex Action or it may be completely out of commission until you can make a Mechanics check to repair it. This is treated as a "No and..." situation. A roll of 3 always fails.


### The Rule of Six

The Rule of Six says anytime something says it Triggered the Rule of Six, you get to roll the Effect Dice again and add it to the total, if you roll 6 again you can add it and roll again. You can keep rolling as long as you roll 6 and add them to the total. This helps with your Total versus a TN but not your Effect.

For example if Sarah rolls 3D6 +7 to attack a security guard and rolls, a 2, 2, and 6 on her Effect Dice, for a total of 10. Sarah re-rolls the Effect Dice and gets 6 again making her total 16, she rolls the 6 again and gets 6 again giving her a 22, she rolls 6 again and gets a 4 adding it to her roll she finishes with a 26.


### Effect
This is where the game really takes off. As long as you succeeded at a Test you are considered to have an Effect of 1. In some cases (like combat) you need to know how well you did. In cases like this the Effect Dice result will tell you what your Effect is. There are Limits to how much Effect you can apply regardless of how much you ended up getting on the dice, or even from rolling a Nat 18. 

- You cannot exceed your Weapons Accuracy in Effect
- You cannot exceed your Limits on your character

#### Net Effect

This was added for Shadowrun. If you see something that says "Net Hits" it means Net Effect. If you see something that says "hit" or {hits} it is referring to the Effect Dice.

On occasion loike breaking a Barrier, you need to compare the Effect Rating of the Barrier against your Effect and see if you got through it. 

In this case you take your `Effect - Target's Effect Rating` the result is **Net Effect** if its positive you won, if its not you failed. Often times when you succeed something happens like carry over damage. 

In an opposed test, you are aiming to roll higher. In cases where Effect is important compare your "Net Effect" or "Net Hits" is the value of the Effect Dice.

> It Shadowrun you roll a pool of dice, they roll of pool of dice whoever gets more hits wins, and the net hits counts. In Sixfinity it is assumed you already out rolled them and the Effect Dice indicates what the net effect is.

### Advantage and Disadvantage

Advantage means you get an extra 1D6 added to roll and take the three highest.

Disadvanatage means you roll 4D6 and take the three lowest.


### Success Tests
A Success test means you are rolling your dice, adding your modifiers and comparing against a {TN}



### Opposed Tests
Is where you roll a specified test and your opponent rolls a specified test. You compare the results which ever is higher wins. On a tie the defender wins.


### Extended Tests

An Extended test has 3 Components: 

1. Target Number Required
2. Number of Successful Attempts
3. Time Interval Per Test

Often written like this: Perform a Mechanics (15,5,1 day) Extended Test. This means the character must succeed at a Mechanics Test VS {TN} 15, they must do this 5 times, each attempt takes 1 day fail or succeed. 

### Attribute Only Tests

The gamemaster decides when an attribute-only test is called for and what attributes to apply. Attribute-only tests pair two attributes together to form a modifier, although there may be some situations where only one attribute applies. Here are a few attribute-only pairings built to suit situations where no skill suffices.

**COMPOSURE (CHA + WIL)**
---

Some situations are tough to deal with, even for hardened runners. When a character is faced with an emotionally overwhelming situation there are only two choices. Stay and fight or turn into a quivering lump of goo. To find out which one happens, make a `Willpower + Charisma` Test. Take note that repeating similar situations over and again eventually eliminates the need to perform this test. Staring down a group of well-armed foes will be scary at first, but after a character does it a few times the fear gives way to instinct.

**JUDGE INTENTIONS (CHA + INT)**
---

Reading another person is also a matter of instinct. A character can use their instincts to guess at the intentions of another person or to gauge how much they can trust someone. Make an Opposed `Intuition + Charisma` Test against the target’s `Willpower + Charisma`. This is not an exact science. A successful test doesn’t mean the target will never betray you (intentions have been known to change), and deceptive characters can gain another’s confidence easily. This primarily serves as a benchmark or gut instinct about how much you can trust the person you are dealing with.

**LIFTING/CARRYING (BOD + STR)**
---

The baseline for lifting weight is 30 pounds per point of Strength. Anything more than that requires a `Strength + Body Test`. Each Effect increases the max weight lifted by 30 pounds. Lifting weight above your head, as with a clean & jerk, is more difficult. The baseline for lifting weight above the head is 10 pounds per point Strength. Each Effect on the Lifting Test increases the maximum weight you can lift by 10 pounds. Carrying weight is significantly different than lifting weight. Characters can carry Strength x 20 pounds in gear without effort. Additional weight requires a Lifting Test. Each Effect increases the maximum by 20 pounds. For more details on carrying gear, see Carrying Gear.

**MEMORY (LOG + WIL)**
---

While there are numerous mnemonic devices designed for remembering information, memory is not a skill. If a character needs to recall information make a `Logic + Willpower` Test.

Glitches can have a devastating effect on memory. A glitch means the character misremembers some portion of the information, such as order of numbers in a passcode. A critical glitch means the character has completely fooled himself into believing and thus remembering something that never actually happened.

**RESIST KNOCKDOWN (STR)**
---

When you take more damage in a single attack than your Physical Limit x 3 you must avoid being knocked prone. Do this with a `3D6 + STR VS Damage Taken or 10 whichever is higher` success means you stay on your feet, failure you are knocked prone. If you take 30 damage in a single attack you are automatically knocked down regardless of the roll. 

**TOXIN RESISTANCE TEST (BOD + WIL)**
---

`Body + Willpower + the rating of any protective gear/systems`; each Effect reduces the toxin’s Power by 1 point. If the Power is reduced to zero, the toxic substance takes no effect; otherwise, apply the effect depending on the remaining Power level.

### Courage Points

Courage is a character’s luck, the favor of the gods, that unexplainable factor that allows her to beat the odds. A character’s Courage attribute represents the number of Courage points a character has to spend during gameplay. Courage points can be used for a wide range of benfits, each noted below. Courage points that are spent are temporarily unavailable (see Regaining Courage, below)—luck will only take you so far. Note that a character’s Courage attribute never actually changes, even when Courage points are spent, unless the character permanently burns Courage (see Burning Courage)

Humans can have 7 **maximum** courage, other species the **maximum** is 6 without the Lucky Edge. 

Spent Courage refreshes every game session. Or whenever the GM says it does.

On a long rest you get 1 Courage back.

**Optional Rule:** You can refresh a point of Courage on a Critical Success as long as no Courage was spent on that test.

Burnt Courage is gone. You have to buy more with Experience.

#### Spending Courage 

A character can only spend Courage points on her own actions; she cannot spend it on behalf of others (except when engaged in a “teamwork” test). You can only use Courage once on any test/roll or challenge. If you spent a point of Courage for extra dice and rolled a critical glitch anyway, for example, you cannot use Courage to negate that critical glitch since you have already applied Courage to that test.

Spending Courage can do the following, players choice:

- Push the Limit: Re-roll your Effect Die and add the new result to your Effect total. The Rule of Six applies. This triggers the same effect as if you had rolled a Nat 18. 
- Action Surge: By spending a Courage point you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your combat turn, you can take one additional action
- Seize the Initiative: Jump to the top of the initiative order. A character cannot both Blitz and Seize the Initiative in the same combat turn.
- Dead Man’s Trigger: When reduced to 0 Physical Health or about to die, you immediately regain half your Physical Health. This can only be used once per Breather or Long Rest (5 minutes / 6 hours).
- Close Call: Either negate the effects of one glitch or turn a critical glitch into a glitch.



#### Burning Courage

In certain drastic situations, even spending Courage may not be enough. A character can choose to burn a point of Courage permanently reducing his Courage attribute by 1 for one of the following effects:

- Crits and Things: Burn 1 Courage to get +10 to your roll and 6 Effect.
- Not Dead Yet: When facing death you somehow survive. You still take all the negative effects of what happened such as lost limbs, you are just not dead. You are not dying either, you are stable.


### Individual Rule Sections

These sections are referenced in other locations in the book for how something works. This is the central repository for this information instead of scattering it all over the book in Combat, Equipment, etc. 

#### Direct Neural Interface or DNI

A direct neural interface, or DNI, connects your brain to electronic devices. Direct neural interface (along with a sim module) is required for VR use, but DNI is also useful for AR in that you don’t need any additional gear like earbuds or an image link to see or hear augmented reality objects. How do you sign up? You get DNI by wearing trodes, or having an implanted datajack, commlink, or cyberdeck. And if you’re using a sim module along with your DNI, you can get a sort of “super AR mode” where you can also feel, smell, and taste your AR experience.

#### Grenades

When throwing a grenade, choose a location as a target. Use a Throw Weapon Simple Action and make a Throwing Weapons + Agility [Physical] (TN 18) Test modified for range and all the usual conditions. Success means the grenade lands right where you wanted. If you don’t meet the TN, the grenade scatters. The gamemaster determines scatter by consulting the Scatter Table (Determine Scatter). Hitting the TN on the test means no scatter, but it is still possible to hit the target if the scatter roll is low and the thrower got some Effect (see Determine Scatter). This all goes back to the old saying: “Close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades.”

Grenades are small, self-contained explosive or gasdelivery packages. They may come with a built-in timer to detonate after a pre-set amount of time (usually three seconds), a motion-sensor set to detonate on impact, or a wireless link set to detonate upon remote command. The type of detonation device determines the special rules and timing of grenade explosions.

Built-in Timer: This detonation method uses the attacker’s Initiative Score as the determining factor for detonation. The grenade is thrown during the character’s Action Phase and detonates in the next Combat Turn on the Initiative Score in which it was thrown minus 10, regardless of any additional changes to the thrower’s Initiative Score.

Motion Sensor: Grenades using a motion sensor are extremely dangerous. Once armed (about a second after the sensor is activated) the grenade explodes after any sudden stop or change in direction, meaning hitting the wall, floor, or target. This method uses the standard Ranged Attack rules but adds an extra step if it misses the target (no net Effect on the attack roll). After a failed attack roll, the thrower must roll for scatter and the grenade scatters the full amount before exploding immediately. A glitch on the attack roll means the grenade does not detonate on initial impact but instead doubles the scatter distance and explodes. A Critical Glitch means the thrower waited too long, and the throw sets off the grenade. The grenade detonates immediately, affecting the attacker and those around him. (Warned you it was dangerous.)

Wireless Link: This is the safest way to throw a grenade in some aspects, but it also comes with some risk and effort. The thrower (or anyone else who has a mark on the grenade) can detonate it by a wireless link. This requires the attacker to have a direct neural interface to the linked device and use the Change Wireless Device Mode Free Action. This method also reduces scatter. Without a DNI the attacker must use the Change Linked Device Mode Simple Action in their next or any of their subsequent Action Phases to detonate the grenade and scatter is not reduced.

##### Determine Scatter

If the attacker misses their intended landing spot, the gamemaster must determine the projectile’s scatter. The gamemaster determines the direction of the scatter by rolling 2D6 and consulting the Scatter Diagram. The 7 arrow indicates the direction of the launch, so a result of 7 means the projectile continued on past the target, while a result of 12 or 2 means the projectile scatters back in the direction of the attacker. Having determined the direction of the scatter, the gamemaster calculates the distance. The Scatter Table indicates a number of dice rolled based on the projectile, which is reduced by the number of Effect the attacker rolled. This is used to determine the final scatter distance. If the scatter distance is reduced to 0 or less, the projectile hits the target exactly. (Note that additional Effect do not add to Damage Values).

| Roll | Direction from Target |
| ---- | --------------------- |
| 2,12 | 6 oclock, south       |
| 3    | 8 oclock, SW          |
| 4    | 9 oclock, W           |
| 5    | 10 oclock,            |
| 6    | 11 oclock, NW         |
| 7    | 12 oclock, N          |
| 8    | 1 oclock, NE          |
| 9    | 2 oclock              |
| 10   | 3 oclock, E           |
| 11   | 5 oclock, SE          |


**Scatter Table**
---

| Type                | Scatter              |
| ------------------- | -------------------- |
| Standard Grenade    | (1D6 – Effect) yards |
| Aerodynamic Grenade | (2D6 – Effect) yards |
| Grenade Launcher    | (3D6 – Effect) yards |
| Missile Launcher    | (4D6 – Effect) yards |
| Rocket Launcher     | (5D6 – Effect) yards |

#### Grenade Launchers, Rockets, & Missiles

Occasionally, characters get their hands on military- grade hardware, like grenade launchers, missiles, and rocket launchers. Resolving a launched grenade, rocket, or missile attack is a two-step process. The first step determines where the projectile ends up in relation to the target (see Determine Scatter). The second step resolves the effect of the projectile’s explosion.

When you fire a grenade, rocket, or missile you use a Attack Complex Action and roll a Heavy Weapons + Agility [Accuracy] (TN 18) Test modified for range and all the usual conditions. Success means the launched weapon hits right where you wanted. If you don’t meet the TN, the projectile scatters. The gamemaster determines scatter by consulting the Scatter Table.

#### Blast Effects

Grenades, rockets, and missiles are area-effect weapons, meaning that their blast affects a given area and any targets within it. The farther away the target is from the explosive’s final location—the blast point—the less damage it takes, because distance reduces the effect of an explosive’s blast. Different grenade, rocket, and missile types lose blast effect at different rates. Consult the Grenades/ Rockets/Missiles Table to find the projectile’s Damage Code and Damage Value reduction rate.

#### TOXINS, DRUGS, AND BTLS

The Sixth World is a vicious place; it seems like something is always trying to do you harm. It’s not always a physical weapon, either. Sometimes it’s a fragging molecule or simsense program. Toxins come in a stunning array of forms in Shadowrun, some of them weaponized, some of them recreational. This section will deal with them. It opens with those toxins used primarily as weapons against the characters. Following those come the more recreational pharmaceuticals and their technological cousins. Then we finish up with rules and guidelines for substance abuse and addiction.

##### TOXINS

Knockout drugs. Truth serum. Nerve gas. All of these are examples of toxins, a catch-all term for a substance that’s mostly meant for use as a weapon, as opposed to recreation. Each substance has several attribute ratings.

**Vector**
---

This shows how the toxin is delivered to the target.

Contact toxins can be solid, liquid, or gaseous. They attack the victim through the skin. These toxins, if in liquid form, can be coated on a weapon. In this case, they can be applied with a successful Melee Attack, whether the attack causes damage or not. A chemical seal offers complete protection from this vector, unless it’s breached. Chemical protection gives a modifier equal to its rating to the target’s Toxin Resistance Test.

Ingestion toxins must be eaten by the victim. They can be solids or liquids. Since they must be eaten, they generally take longer to have an effect. Toxin extractor bioware provides a modifier equal to the rating of the augmentation to resist ingested and other toxins.

Inhalation toxins are applied as an aerosol spray or gas, and they must be breathed in by the target. Gas masks, chemical seals, and active internal air tanks provide immunity to inhalation toxins. Chemical protection gives bonus modifier to the Toxin Resistance Test equal to its rating.

Injection toxins must get into the target’s bloodstream, whether through a dart, hypodermic needle, or a cut. These can also be used to coat an edged melee weapon. They are applied to the target with a successful melee attack that causes damage.

**Speed**
---

This determines how quickly the victim suffers the toxin’s Effect. These effects are always applied at the end of a Combat Turn.




## Chapter 5: Edges & Flaws

### Edges
These provide bonuses in role playing situations, situational modifiers, and permanent effects. 


#### Ambidextrous

Cost: 4 XP

The character can use and handle objects equally well with both hands. The character does not suffer disadvantage for using an off-hand weapon. When using two weapons at once, however, the character must still get disadvantage on the off hand attack. 

#### Analytical Mind

Cost: 5

Analytical Mind describes the uncanny ability to logically analyze information, deduce solutions to problems, or separate vital information from distractions and noise. It’s useful in cracking cyphers, solving puzzles, figuring out traps, and sifting through data. This quality gives the character a Advantage to any Mental Tests involving pattern recognition, evidence analysis, clue hunting, or solving puzzles. This quality also reduces the time it takes the character to solve a problem by half.

#### Animal Empathy

Cost: 5 XP

A character with Animal Empathy has an intuitive sense for understanding and handling animals of all kinds.

Effect: You gain a Advantage on all Tests made to influence, calm, train, guide, or control animals (this includes riding, driving, or directing them).

#### Aptitude

Cost: 14 XP

This quality is how you become even better than the best in the world. The standard limit for skills is 6. Every so often, there is a character who can exceed limitations and be truly exceptional in a particular skill. With this particular quality, the character can have one skill rated at 7 at character creation, and may eventually build that skill up to rating 7. Characters may only take the Aptitude quality once.

#### Astral Chameleon

Cost: 10 XP

With the Astral Chameleon quality, the character’s astral signature blends into the background of astral space and is difficult to detect. All signatures left by the character last only half as long as other astral signatures. Any individuals assensing astral signatures left behind by a character with this quality receive a –2 modifier for the Assensing Test. Only characters with a Magic rating and capable of leaving astral signatures may have this quality.

#### Bilingual 

Cost: 5 XP

A character with this quality reads, writes, and speaks a second language fluently. They can list a second language as a native tongue (see Language Skills). **This quality can only be acquired at character creation**; selecting it gives the character a second free language skill during Step Five: Purchase Active, Knowledge, and Language Skills.

#### Blandness

Cost: 8 XP

This character blends into a crowd; he’s seldom noticed and easily forgotten. He is unremarkable in every aspect of physical appearance. Anyone attempting to describe the character cannot come up with anything more precise than “average height, average build, average hair, etc.” Increase the {TN} tier for anyone to recall specific details about the character by 1. This means a Memory Test with a difficulty of Average ({TN} 10) becomes a Hard test ({TN} 15).

Individuals attempting to shadow or physically locate a character with the Blandness quality in a populated setting receive a –2 modifier on all tests related to their search. The same penalty applies if they’re asking around about the person based on the individual’s physical appearance. If the character acquires any visible tattoos, scars, or other distinguishing features, the bonuses from the Blandness quality go away until the distinctive features are removed from the character’s appearance.

In certain circumstances and specific situations, the gamemaster may determine that Blandness does not apply. For example, a Troll with the Blandness quality still towers head and shoulders over a crowd of humans and so still stands out, no matter how average they dress. The character only regains his bonus by leaving the situation where he stands out.

#### Catlike

Cost: 7 XP

A character with the Catlike quality is gifted with an uncanny elegance, a stealthy gait, and an almost preternatural ability to move without making a sound.

They also claim they land on their feet when dropped, though they tend not to let people test this. This quality adds a Advantage to Sneaking skill tests.

#### Codeslinger

Cost: 10 XP

You are exceptionally skilled at navigating the Net and executing digital intrusions.

Effect: You gain a Advantage on all Tests involving hacking, intrusion, or similar Net-based actions.

Restriction: This Edge may only be taken once.

#### Double Jointed

Cost: 6 XP

Your joints are unusually flexible, allowing you to bend and contort your body into extreme positions.

Effect: You gain a Advantage on all Sleight of Hand Tests when performing escape artist actions, such as slipping out of cuffs, ropes, or other restraints.

GM Discretion: You may also attempt to squeeze into cramped or narrow spaces where a less limber character could not fit.


#### Exceptional Attribute

Cost: 14 XP

Some individuals push beyond the natural limits of their species, embodying rare physical or mental potential.

Effect: Choose one Attribute. Your natural maximum for that Attribute increases by +1 above your species’ normal maximum.

Example: A Human with Exceptional Attribute could raise one Attribute to 7 instead of the usual maximum of 6.

Augmented Maximum: The augmented maximum for that Attribute also increases by +1.

Restriction: This Edge may only be taken once.


#### First Impression

Cost: 11 XP

You have a natural knack for sliding into new places and situations as if you belong there.

Effect: You gain a Advantage on all Social Tests made during your first interaction in a new environment—whether infiltrating a group, meeting contacts in a new city, or joining a fresh team.

Limitation: The bonus only applies during the initial encounter. Subsequent meetings and interactions are unaffected.



#### Focused Concentration

Cost: 4 XP (Maxium 6 Rating)

A magician with the Focused Concentration quality has the discipline to manipulate mana more precisely than otherwise possible. This precision reduces stress to the magician. She is able to sustain one spell form with a force/level equal to her Focused Concentration rating without suffering any penalties. For example, a magician with Focused Concentration rating 3 may sustain a Force 3 Armor spell without taking the negative modifier for sustaining a spell. Sustaining any additional spells incurs the standard –2 modifier per spell sustained to Fatigue checks. This quality may only be taken by magician characters that are able to cast spells.

#### Gearhead

Cost: 11 XP

The Gearhead is who you look for when it’s time to stomp on the gas and move. She’s a natural-born driver or pilot. When she’s at the wheel/stick/controls of a vehicle or drone, she has an intuitive understanding of its limitations and its capabilities and is able to coax whatever machine she’s controlling to perform at its best. During vehicle or chase combat, a Gearhead can increase the Speed of her vehicle or drone by 20 percent or increase the Handling modifier by +1 (player’s choice). She also receives a Advantage when attempting difficult maneuvers or stunts in the vehicle. This bonus lasts for 1D6 minutes.

The player can choose to make this bonus last up to an additional 1D6 minutes if she wants. Doing so pushes the vehicle or drone well beyond its design limits and risks catastrophic damage. For each minute the character pushes the vehicle past its initial bonus period, the vehicle automatically takes one point of stress damage (unresisted)

#### Guts

Cost: 10 XP

When a bug spirit with dripping mandibles comes calling, the character with Guts is the one most likely to stand and fight instead of freaking the hell out. Guts gives a character a Advantage on tests to resist fear and intimidation, including magically induced fear from spells or critter powers.

#### High Pain Tolerance

Cost: 7 XP per rating (max rating 3)

Your Lifeblood is increased by 1 per rating.

Restriction: Maximum rating is 3.

#### Human Looking

Cost: 5 XP

Some non-humans can pass for human in most day-to-day situations. Their appearance, mannerisms, and presence blend well enough that most people simply assume they are baseline human.

Effect: Human NPCs treat you with a neutral baseline attitude when making Social Tests, unless given a reason to react otherwise.

Complications: You may suffer increased hostility from non-human NPCs who resent humans—or who think you’re “trying too hard” to look like one.

Restriction: Only Elves, Dwarves, and Orcs may take this Edge.

#### Indomitable

Cost: 8 XP Per rating (Max 3)

Bodies and minds have limits, but some people have the will to push right through those boundaries. For each level of Indomitable, a character receives a +1 increase to an Inherent limit of his choice (Mental, Physical, or Social). He can take up to three levels and can apply them in any way he chooses (+3 to one Inherent Limit, for example; or +2 to one Inherent and +1 to another; or +1 to all three).


#### Lucky

Cost: 12 XP

Some individuals have an indomitable spirit that pushes beyond the limits of their species.

Effect: Your Courage Attribute maximum increases by +1 above your species’ normal limit.

Example: A Human with Exceptional Courage could raise Courage to 8 instead of the usual maximum of 7.

Advancement: This Edge does not grant an immediate increase to Courage; it only raises the cap. The Experience cost for raising the Attribute must still be paid through normal advancement.

Restriction: This Edge may only be taken once.


#### Magic Resistance

Cost: 6 XP per rating (max rating 4)

You have an innate resistance to magical effects, making it harder for spells to take hold—whether harmful or helpful.

Effect: For every 6 XP spent, you gain a +1 bonus on all Spell Resistance Tests. A magically resistant character cannot choose
to lower his magical resistance; it affects all spells and magical effects, good or bad. A character with Magic Resistance is never a willing subject for spells that require a voluntary subject; such spells automatically fail when used on magic resistant characters.

Limitation: This resistance applies to all spells, even beneficial ones such as Heal.

Scaling: This Quality may be taken multiple times, increasing your modifier by +1 for each purchase (up to the maximum of 4).

#### Natural Athlete

Cost: 7 XP

A character with this quality has an innate combination of physical fitness, spatial awareness, and natural athletic or gymnastic talent. While the character may not be a world-class athlete and may require training to achieve peak performance, he is in prime physical shape for his size and weight class. The Natural Athlete adds a Advantage for Running and Gymnastics skill tests.

#### Natural Immunity

Cost: 4 XP or 10 XP

You have an innate or developed resistance to a specific toxin or disease.

Effect:

4 XP: You are completely immune to one natural disease or toxin.

10 XP: You are completely immune to one synthetic (artificially engineered) disease or toxin.

Limitations:

This Quality does not apply to magically based diseases or toxins (such as lycanthropy).

The chosen disease, drug, or poison must be something your character could reasonably have been exposed to. The player and GM must agree on the specific agent.

Exposure: You may safely ingest or be exposed to one dose every (12 – Body) hours with no ill effects. If more than one dose is taken during that period, you suffer normal damage but your recovery time is halved.

Contagion: Immunity does not make you non-contagious. Characters immune to a disease can still carry and transmit it to others, even without symptoms.

### Flaws

Flaws provide bonus XP that can be used toward the cost of attributes, skills, edges, and other resources and abilities. Characters may not earn more than 35 XP from purchasing Flaws.

#### Addiction

Bonus: 4 to 25 XP

A character with the Addiction flaw is addicted to alcohol, drugs, or a similar substance with a detrimental effect on the character’s health (note that nicotine, caffeine, and sugar do not count). The value of this flaw depends on how severe the addiction is: Mild, Moderate, Severe, or Burnout. 

Mild (4 XP): the addiction is omnipresent but not blatant or intrusive; it may not even be recognized or acknowledged. At this stage it is easier to seek help, but very few recognize their addiction as something needing help at this stage. Addicts experience cravings at least once a week (if not every few days), but can ignore them if necessary without too much difficulty. The addict suffers a –2 modifier to Willpower and/or Stamina Tests to resist the craving.

Moderate (9 XP): the addiction at this stage is marked and  difficult to overcome. Addicts experience cravings at least once a day (if not more), and they are more difficult to ignore. The addict suffers a –4 modifier to Willpower and/or Stamina Tests to resist the craving.

Severe (20 XP): the addiction is out of control. The addict experiences constant cravings (at least twice a day), suffering a –6 modifier to Willpower and/or Stamina Tests to keep from giving in.

Burnout (25 XP): this is the same as a Severe addiction, except the addict has been in this state for some time and is experiencing the tell-tale signs of habitual use on his body. The character is always under the Exhausted condition. If the character does not kick the habit soon, he will continue to suffer advancing Fatigue at a rate determined by the gamemaster until he dies

#### Allergy

Bonus: Below

| Condition | Value in XP | Description                                                                                                 |
| --------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Uncommon  | 2           | The substance or condition is rare for the local environment. Example Silver,Gold                           |
| Common    | 7           | The substance or condition is common for the local environment. Examples Sunlight, plastic.                 |
| Mild      | 3           | Symptoms are discomforting and distracting.  –2 modifier to all tests made while experiencing the symptoms. |
| Moderate  | 8           | Contact with the allergen produces intense pain. –4 to all tests made while experiencing the symptoms       |
| Severe    | 13          | As Moderate but Vulnerable to weapons that do this damage                                                   |

A character with the Allergy flaw is allergic to a substance or condition. The value of this flaw depends on two factors. 

First, determine whether the substance or condition is Uncommon (2 XP) or Common (7 XP). then determine the severity of the symptoms: Mild (3 XP), Moderate (8 XP), or Severe (13 XP). Add the appropriate point values to find the final value. For example, the value of an Uncommon Moderate Allergy is 10 (2 + 8) points. The Allergy Table above gives descriptions of conditions and severity.

#### Astral Beacon

Bonus: 10 XP

The astral signature of a character with the Astral Beacon quality is like, well, a beacon—highly visible on the astral plane. The signature also lasts twice as long as it would without the Astral Beacon quality and others assensing it receive advantage to their Assensing Test for gathering information about it. Only characters with a Magic rating may take this quality.

#### Bad Luck

Bonus: 12 XP

This character is cursed—his own luck often turns against him. Whenever this character uses Courage, roll 1D6. On a result of 1, the Courage is spent, but it has the exact opposite effect intended. For example, if a character hopes to gain a reroll dice to take the higher option, instead he takes the lower option. If a character spends Courage to go first in an Initiative, he ends up going last. If a character spent Courage to negate a glitch, Bad Luck turns it into a critical glitch.

#### Codeblock

Bonus: 10 XP

The character is hopeless at actions with computers. Anytime they interact with the Net or a computer they get a Disadvantage to their rolls. 

#### Combat paralysis

Bonus: 12 XP

A character with Combat Paralysis freezes in combat situations. On the character’s first Initiative Test in combat, the character
rolls Initiative with disadvantage. On the second and subsequent Initiative Tests, however, the character rolls his normal Initiative. The character also receives a –3 modifier on Surprise Tests.

#### Gremlins

Bonus: 4 XP per rating (max rating 4)

Characters with the Gremlins flaw never seem to get along with technology. Devices malfunction inexplicably in the character’s hands, software constantly crashes whenever he uses it, components become unusually fragile at his touch, and wireless links suffer faltering connections and odd interference.

For every 4 XP gained in this flaw, increase the number of rolled 1s required to get a glitch (normally 3) by 1 whenever the character is attempting to use a moderately sophisticated device (late 20th century technology or later). 

For example, a character with a Gremlins Rating 2 (10 XP) would trigger a glitch if five or more 1s result from a test. The gamemaster may also require the character to make a test for operations that would otherwise succeed automatically, simply to see whether or not a glitch occurs.

When describing the effects of a Gremlin-induced glitch, gamemasters should play up the notion of a particularly weird mechanical or electronic malfunction. For example, if a Gremlin-plagued character glitches while shooting a pistol, the clip might inexplicably fall out of the gun, or the slide might jump off the rails and go flying into the distance. 

Note that Gremlins is a Negative quality—its effects should be hindering to the character (and entertaining to others). Gremlins should not be used as an “offensive ability,” where a character causes his opponent’s high-tech toys to fall apart merely by touching them.

Consider Gremlins to be a curse on the character—if he wants the technology to fail, then it should be more likely not to. this effect only applies to external equipment.

#### Incompetent

Bonus: 5 XP

A character who is Incompetent possesses a total lack of knowledge or ability with a certain Active skill. If this quality is taken, the player must specify an Active skill in which the character is Incompetent. Incompetent may not be applied to Language or Knowledge skills.

The character is treated as having a skill level of “unaware” for that particular skill. In some cases, a Success Test may be required to perform certain tasks that most people take for granted. Characters may not possess that skill, nor may they default on it. Gamemasters are free to reject any choices that would prove irrelevant or exploitative in actual play.

Incompetent may be purchased more than once, choosing a separate skill each time.

#### Loss of Confidence

Bonus: 10 XP

The Loss of Confidence quality means something has caused the character to lose confidence in himself and one of his abilities. Though a skilled hacker, he failed to hack into a Starbucks host, or despite high Agility, he glitched an easy Climbing Test and fell into a dumpster— whatever the reason, he now doubts himself and his abilities. In tests involving the affected skill, the character suffers a –2 modifier. If the character has a specialization with the skill, the character cannot use that specialization while suffering a loss of confidence.

The skill chosen for the character to have a Loss of Confidence must be one that the character prides himself in and has invested in building. Only skills with a rating 4 or higher may suffer the Loss of Confidence quality. Courage may not be used for tests involving this skill when the character is suffering Loss of Confidence.

#### Low Pain Threshold

Bonus: 9 XP

Your Lifeblood is reduced by 1 (minimum 0).



#### Uncouth

Bonus: 14 XP

Uncouth characters are antisocial or sociopathic and have a difficult time interacting with others. The cost for learning or improving Social skills is twice normal for Uncouth characters (including at character creation), and they may never take Aptitude in a Social skill.

Additionally, Uncouth characters are treated as “unaware” in any Social skills that they do not possess at Rating 1 or higher. The gamemaster may require the character to make Success Tests for social situations that normal people would have no problems with.

#### Uneducated

Bonus: 8 XP

An Uneducated character has grown up far away from the modern world and is thus
ignorant of modern society in general, possessing only a rudimentary knowledge of reading,
writing, and arithmetic. this is quality is fitting for characters who grew up in primitive societies or back-to-the-land anti-technological communes (for example, Amazonian primitives, Luddite collectives). This quality also applies to certain sentient creatures that have developed their own primitive society.

Characters with the Uneducated quality are considered “unaware” in Knowledge skills they do not possess, and they may not default on skill tests for those skills. The gamemaster may also require the character to make Success Tests for ordinary tasks that the typical person takes for granted. Additionally, the Experience cost for learning new skills or improving existing ones in these categories is twice normal (including at character creation), and the character may never take Aptitude in one of these skills.

#### Unsteady Hands

Bonus: 7 XP

A character with Unsteady Hands has mild shakes that affect the dexterity and finesse in his hands. The character suffers a –2 modifier for all Agility-based tests when symptoms manifest themselves. The condition could be physiological (an untreated genetic disorder or damaged nerves, for example), caused by psychological trauma, or even be symptomatic of age. Certain augmentations or medications can mask these symptoms under normal circumstances. Under more stressful situations in the course of the run, there is a chance the Unsteady Hands condition can reappear. The character makes an Agility + Body ({TN} 20) Test following a stressful encounter (combat, for example). A successful test means the character does not experience the symptoms of this condition (this time). A failed test causes the difficulties associated with unsteady hands to re-emerge, and they remain with the character for the remainder of the run.

#### Tracked (Layered)

Bonus: 5 or 25 XP

There are four levels of tracking. They have a record of some sort making them easily tracked.

- National: At the 5 XP level, the character has what is called Nationally Tacked. They have done something to get on the National Tracking list. The government of the country tracking you keeps loose tabs on your activities. 
- Criminal Record: At the 10 XP level the character has a Criminal Record. At some point in his life, the character was arrested and served time for a felony-level offense and was branded a criminal for the rest of his life. He is legally required to alert authorities of his travel and whereabouts at all times; failure to do so is a felony and can lead to re-incarceration. He is shunned by law-abiding society.
- Corporate Tracked: At the 15 XP level the character works for, worked for, or has had dealings with one of the majoe mega-corporations. This corporation keeps close tabs on you, your travel, transactions etc. Corporations do not have the adhere to privacy laws and can be quite overbearing in their tracking, it will be difficult to ever hide anything from them.
- Corporate Warrant: At the 25 XP level this character is actively wanted by a Megacorporation. They have few limits, near unlimited resources and never forget anything.

#### Vulnerability

Bonus: 10 XP

This character is Vulnerable to a type of special damage (not impact or ballistic) such as Fire or Cold. 

#### Weak Immune System

Bonus: 5 XP or 10 XP

This character is at Disadvantage on certain tests. For 5 XP they are at disadvantage to Stamina tests versus Disease. For 10 XP they are disadvantage on tests versus Poisons and Toxins as well as other hazards like Radiation. 




## Chapter 6: Skills

> Note Sixfinity does not use Skill Groups

Base skills are the fundamental skills in Sixfinity. Whereas attributes represent an individual’s inherent capacities, skills are abilities an individual learns over time. Each skill represents the training and methods a character has picked up that enable her to use her natural attributes in a certain way. To reflect this connection, each skill is linked to an attribute. A list of skills and their linked attributes appears in the Skills and Linked Attributes Table, below.

Skills are grouped into two broad categories: Active, and Knowledge. Characters begin the game with a set of skills chosen by the player.

During game play, characters can improve or specialize in skills, or learn new ones as they experience new things. 

**Active Skills**
---

Active skills are the skills characters use to take action, affect something, or somehow make an impact. These skills are the ones that usually matter the most to characters. Firing a gun, negotiating, driving a car , and so on. For a complete description of base Active skills and specializations see below.

**Knowledge Skills**
---

Knowledge Skills represent what a character knows about certain subjects. Beginning Knowledge skills are based on a character’s Willpower and Logic attributes. Knowledge skills are useful for fleshing out a character by defining her background or areas of interest, and are used in the game most often to represent legwork, show character development, or allow characters to come up with information they might not otherwise have a chance to gain. they can range from fields of knowledge important in the game universe—such as Corporate Finance, Political History, Research, or Magic—to more esoteric, bizarre, or mundane interests such as trash Metal Bands, or Elven Wines.

Knowledge skills fall into four categories: Stree, Academic, Interests, and Professional.

Each category presents an opportunity to shape the experiences of a character far beyond what happens on a run. Knowledge skills do not affect tests the way Active skills do. In certain cases Knowledge skills may provide the background needed to complete an action, but they typically do not provide dice for Active skill tests. You get a number of free Knowledge skill points at character creation. Skill advancement and additional Knowledge skills follow the skill advancement rules (Character Advancement).

Knowledge skills complement your character. They create meaning and history behind the Active skills and abilities you choose. Shadowrun gives you some room to play with Knowledge skills. You’re free to take practically any Knowledge skill your can think up for your character. Knowledge skills are meant to represent a limited set of knowledge the character could have gained in some in-game fashion. For example, a kid growing up in an Evo corporate enclave could have a skill in Corporate Culture. On the other hand, had she tried to take Culture as a Knowledge skill, it would have been way too broad to be a Knowledge skill and her gamemaster would have told her she needs to narrow it down a bit. Check out the Knowledge Skill Examples to get a good idea about how to hit the Knowledge skill sweet spot

**STREET KNOWLEDGE**
---

Street Knowledge is linked to Intuition. This type of Knowledge skill is about knowing the movers and shakers in an urban area, along with how things get done on the street. You know about the people who live in different neighborhoods, who to ask to get what, and where things are. The information that these skills cover tends to change rapidly, but your instincts help you keep up.

**ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE**
---

Academic knowledge is linked to Logic. This type of knowledge includes university subjects such as history, science, design, technology, magical theory, and the people and organizations with fingers in those pies. The humanities (cultures, art, philosophy, and so on) are also included in this category.

**PROFESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE**
---

Professional Knowledge skills deal with subjects related to normal trades, professions, and occupations, things like journalism, engineering, business, and so on. You might find them helpful when doing legwork for a run, especially those in the corporate world. All Professional Knowledge skills are linked to Logic.

**INTERESTS**
---

Strange as it might sound, you might have some hobbies outside of slinging mana and bullets. Interests are the kind of Knowledge skill that describes what you know because of what you do for fun. There are no guidelines (and no limit) to the sort of interest skills you can have. Interest Knowledge skills are linked to Intuition.

**Languages**
---

There are few situations where language skills should require a dice roll. Characters with a language skill don’t need to make tests to understand one another in every day situations. The character’s skill level serves as a benchmark for how well they can communicate in a foreign language over time. However, in critical situations where precise translation is important, a gamemaster may elect to require a Language skill test. For more information, see Using Language Skills.

**LINGOS**
---

Lingos are informal languages formed out of a mother tongue and heavy with slang, jargon, and culturally significant metaphorical language. Lingos arise out of professional and often cultural need. For example, the Cityspeak word ”wiz” came from jargon specific to the magically active. Lingos are specializations of base languages.

| Name       | Meaning                                                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cityspeak  | A Japanese/English pidgin spoken in Seattle                   |
| Creole     | A French/English hybrid spoken in the CAS                     |
| Street     | Localized jive based on a city’s street population            |
| ‘l33tspeak | Decker code talk                                              |
| Milspec    | Military jargon shared between soldiers/mercs                 |
| Corp       | Technical banter shared by corporate office staff and lawyers |
| Orbital    | Jargon shared by off-world colonies                           |

**USING LANGUAGE SKILLS**
---

A gamemaster may elect to call for a Language Test anytime information needs to be translated hurriedly or in a tense situation. The Language Skill Table suggests thresholds for the test as well as possible modifiers. Failing a Language Test means the parties are unable to understand each other. If a glitch is rolled, some meaningful portion of the information is presumed to be understood but is actually misunderstood. The gamemaster may want to make the Language Test secretly, in order to maintain the illusion that the characters understand what is going on.

**Skill Ratings**

Skill ratings are the numerical values assigned to skills or skill groups, either at character creation or when the skill is learned during game play. They represent how good a character is at a task when using that particular skill. Skill ratings are written as the name of the skill, followed by the rating. For example, Sneaking 3 means the character has the Sneaking Skill at a rating of 3. The skill rating is added to the linked attribute to determine the modifier added to 3D6 when that skill is used. For example, if the character with Sneaking 3 also had an Agility 4, she would add 7 to her rolls on a Sneaking Test.

The skill Rating is a numerical value ranging from 1, representing the most rudimentary skill, to 7 (or 13 with the Aptitude quality) representing the height of sentient achievement. 

The unmodified skill rating assigned at character creation or purchased during game play is considered to be the character’s base skill rating. Some abilities and implants (as noted) may increase this rating, creating a modified skill rating. A modified skill cannot exceed the base skill rating x 1.5. Specializations, spells, and other implants may provide a bonus to a skill, but do not change the base skill rating. These extra modifiers are listed in parentheses after the base skill, as in Sneaking 4 (+2)

| Rating | Definition   |
| ------ | ------------ |
| -      | Unaware      |
| 0      | Untrained    |
| 1      | Beginner     |
| 2      | Novice       |
| 3      | Professional |
| 4      | Veteran      |
| 5      | Expert       |
| 6      | Elite        |
| 7      | Legendary    |

### Specializations

If you devote extra time to a subset of a skill, it’s called a specialization. If your character has the Gymnastics skill but spends a lot of time practicing parkour, you get a character that is good at Gymnastics but especially good at climbing past obstacles.

A specialization adds +2 modifier to any test made for that skill when the specialization comes into play. You write the specialization in parentheses right after the skill, and then add a “(+2)” after the rating to remind you of the bonus. Characters can have multiple specializations within the same skill, but one applies at a time. For example, a character with the Blades skill who specializes in Axes and Parrying would only receive a +2 modifier to tests when parrying with an axe.

New characters may only take one specialization per skill at character creation (Creating a Character), but you can buy more later. If you want a specialization in a skill, you have to have it first (meaning a Rating of at least 1). 

### Defaulting

It is impossible to prepare for every scenario and only slightly harder to have every skill. When you perform an action without actually having the skill for the test, there’s still hope. You can default the skill, making the test using only the attribute to form the modifier. You don’t have any tremendous talent when you default— quite the opposite in fact. Defaulting imposes a –1 modifier in addition to any other modifiers the situation demands. Unless the gamemaster feels that you’re at a complete loss when defaulting, you can use Courage to Push the Limit and better your chances.

Some skills are too technically demanding for you to default. In these cases, you don’t get to even try the test; you just fail. Vehicles or Unarmed Combat, for example, are relatively simple skills that can be attempted without formal training, so you can default if you need to. Mechanics, on the other hand, is too complicated to try without some training (you could say it’s rocket science). Skills that cannot be defaulted are given in italics on the Active Skill List—and it’s also mentioned in the skill description.

#### Knowledge Skill Examples 

Knowledge skills are about what the character knows,
even if you, the player, don’t. Check out the KnowledgeSkill Table for a few guidelines on what a skill reveals.
Keep in mind that general facts, such as the name of
the head of a megacorp and such, is info that can be
quickly found on the Matrix. Knowledge skills are not
about that basic level of detail, but rather information
that not everyone knows or can find so easily.

**USING ESCAPE ARTIST**


In Shadowrun, you might just find yourself caught instead of killed. Escape Artist provides a chance to escape from most forms of confinement, including ropes, handcuffs, and other bindings. To get out of restraints, make an `Escape Artist + Agility [Physical]` Test against a TN based on what you’re trying to get out of. If you succeed, you’re free after working on it for one minute (20 Combat Turns), divided by the number of net effect you get on the test. The dice is modified by a variety of factors, such as whether or not you’re being watched (and trying to be subtle) or if you’re carrying a set of lockpicks. These situational modifiers are on the Escape Artist Table. The gamemaster may decide that some restraints are too difficult to escape from without outside help.

**Escape Artist Table**

| **RESTRAINTS**                           | **THRESHOLD**            |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Rope, plastic cuffs                      | 2                        |
| Metal handcuffs                          | 3                        |

| **SITUATION**                            | **MODIFIER**             |
| Character being watched                  | –2                       |
| Character physically restrained          | –(Restrainer’s Strength) |
| Character has picks or cutting implement | +2                       |



##### FREE-FALL (BODY)

This skill covers any jump from height, including leaps from a third-floor window to jumps from a plane at high altitude. If it involves any kind of attempt to slow or control your fall, this covers it, so it includes skydiving with a parachute, flying a wingsuit, or descending on a line, bungee cord, or zipline.


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: None
- Specializations: BASE Jumping, Break-Fall, Bungee, HALO, Low Altitude, Parachute, Static Line, Wingsuit, Zipline

##### GYMNASTICS (AGILITY)

Gymnastics measures your balance, general athleticism, and all-around ability to use your body. For more information on ways Gymnastics may be applied ingame, see Jumping.


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: Athletics
- Specializations: Balance, Climbing, Dance, Leaping, Parkour, Rolling

**USING GYMNASTICS**


**CLIMBING**

The Gymnastics skill is applied to both assisted and unassisted climbing tasks. Assisted climbing is accomplished with specialized gear such as ropes and harnesses. Assisted climbing is easier and safer, but requires more preparation. Unassisted climbing may be done on the fly, because you climb without any gear. Climbing is a Complex Action, and the number of effect you get on your `Gymnastics + Strength [Physical]` Test determines how far you can move vertically or laterally during your climb, as noted on the Climbing Table. The more difficult the climb, the more modifiers you get, which is also noted on the Climbing Table.

**Climbing Table**

| **SITUATION**                                            | **Movement Distance R/up**   |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Assisted climbing down (rappelling)                      | 20 yards + 1 yard per effect |
| Assisted climbing upward                                 | 1 yard per effect            |
| Assisted climbing horizontally                           | 1 yard per 2 effect          |
| Assisted climbing upside down (on a ceiling or overhang) | 1 yard per 3 effect          |
| Unassisted climbing upward                               | 1 yard per 2 effect          |
| Unassisted climbing down                                 | 1 yard per effect            |
| **SITUATION**                                            | **MODIFIER**                 |
| Assisted climbing                                        | +2                           |
| **SURFACE IS**                                           | **MODIFIER**                 |
| Easily climbable (chain-link fence)                      | +1                           |
| Broken (tree, loose stone wall)                          | +0                           |
| Flat (brick wall, side of old building)                  | –3                           |
| Sheer (metal wall, seamless stone)                       | –5                           |
| Slippery or wet                                          | –2                           |
| Greased or gel-treated                                   | –4                           |


**RAPPELLING**

Rappelling is a gear-aided descent at near free-fall speed. This technique requires a `Free-Fall + Body [Physical] (12)` Success Test. So long as you have the proper gear and training, you can brake at any point in the descent, slow your speed, and land safely. Rappelling expends a Simple Action, during which you fall at a rate of 20 yards per Combat Turn. Rappelling characters can increase the number of yards descended during that same Combat Turn by 1 for each net effect beyond the threshold on the Free-Fall Test. If you take another Simple Action in the same phase, such as firing a weapon, you get a –2 modifier to both that action and the Free-Fall Test. Stopping requires another Free-Fall Test with the same threshold. On an unsuccessful test, you don’t slow down and may take damage if you hit the ground at speed (Falling Damage).

**CLIMBING FAILURES AND GLITCHES**

A test while climbing or rappelling automatically halts your progress, and you have to make a `Reaction + Strength` Test to hold on. If you fail this second test, you start to fall (about 20 yards per Combat Turn). During your next turn, you may attempt to stop by making a `Reaction + Strength Test` with a –2 modifier. Your gamemaster may allow other climbers to make a `Reaction + Strength` Test to grab you. Characters who are using climbing gear are allowed an additional test if they fall. Have the character who prepared the safety lines make a `Free-Fall + Logic [Mental]` Test against a threshold equal to half the falling character’s Body (round down). The falling character may apply Courage to this test. If successful, the safety gear catches, leaving the character dangling. If it fails, the character falls (see Falling Damage).

**JUMPING**

Jumping is done from a running or standing position. Running leaps get more distance than standing jumps do, if you have enough room to get up to full speed. Make a `Gymnastics + Agility Test`, applying any appropriate modifiers. For every Effect you get on this test, you jump 1 yard on a standing jump or 2 yards for a running leap. No matter how many effect you get, you can’t jump farther than your Agility x 1.5 yards (net effect beyond this mean you did it with style). For a vertical jump, it’s the same test, but you get half a yard of altitude per hit and the maximum you can jump is 1.5 times your height.


##### PALMING (AGILITY)

Palming is sleight-of-hand skill that gives a character the ability to snag, hide, and pass off small objects.


- Default: No
- Skill Group: Stealth
- Specializations: Legerdemain, Pickpocket, Pilfering

##### PERCEPTION (INTUITION)

Perception refers to the ability to spot anomalies in everyday situations, making it one of the key skills a shadowrunner needs. See Using Perception.


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: None
- Specializations: Hearing, Scent, Searching, Taste, Touch, Visual

**USING PERCEPTION**

Perception Tests are for any situation involving basic senses (sight, hearing, smell, touch, or taste) where you’re looking for something that isn’t obvious. Your gamemaster might call for you to make one, or you can call for a Perception Test by taking an Use Skill Complex Action to get a handle on what’s going down around you. Making the TN on a `Perception + Intuition [Mental]` Test indicates that you’ve noticed something subtle or important (or both)—net effect determine how much detail you get. If someone is deliberately trying to hide from you, they’ll oppose your test with their own skill (Using Stealth Skills). Perception Tests involving vision (which is most of them) use the same Visibility and Light modifiers as attacks do in combat (Environmental Modifiers). Other modifiers are listed on the Perception Test Modifiers table. If a bunch of people are making a Perception Test and looking for the same thing, use a Teamwork Test.

**Perception Test Modifiers table**

| **SITUATION**                                       | **MODIFIER**          |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Perceiver is distracted                             | –2                    |
| Perceiver is specifically looking/ listening for it | +3                    |
| Object/sound not in immediate vicinity              | –2                    |
| Object/sound far away                               | –3                    |
| Object/sound stands out in some way                 | +2                    |
| Interfering sight/odor/sound                        | –2                    |
| Perceiver has active enhancements                   | + (Rating)            |
| Visibility and Light                                | Environmental Factors |

| Hidden/Micro/Silent    | 24               | Secret door, needle in haystack, subvocal speech        |



##### RUNNING (STRENGTH)

Running, as you may guess, is about how much ground you can cover quickly. For more information see Using Running.


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: Athletics
- Specializations: Distance, Sprinting, by terrain (Desert, Urban, Wilderness, etc.)

**USING RUNNING**

The Running skill allows you to increase the distance you can cover in a Combat Turn by taking a Dash Action on your turn. You make a `Running + Strength [Physical] Test`. Each effect adds 1 or 2 yards to your distance for that Combat Turn, based on your metatype (see Movement). The gamemaster may apply modifiers for various types of terrain (rocky, slippery, and so on) and other conditions. You can run non-stop for a maximum number of minutes equal to your `(Body + Running) x 10`. Fatigue damage begins to take effect after this point (see Fatigue Damage).

##### SNEAKING (AGILITY)

Need to get where you’re not supposed to be? This skill allows you to remain inconspicuous in various situations. See Using Stealth Skills.


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: Stealth
- Specializations: Location type (Jungle, Urban, Desert, etc.)

##### SURVIVAL (WILLPOWER)

In the desert with nothing more than a tin cup, a poncho, and an iron rod? You’ll need this skill to help you get out alive. Survival is the ability to stay alive in extreme environmental conditions for extended periods of time. The skill governs a character’s ability to perform vital outdoor tasks such as start a fire, build a shelter, scrounge for food, etc. in hostile environments. See Using Survival.


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: Outdoors
- Specializations: Desert, Forest, Jungle, Mountain, Polar, Urban, or other terrain

**USING SURVIVAL**

Surviving the elements is more dangerous in the Sixth World. Environmental decay has reached unparalleled heights. In Great Britain, for example, a perfect storm of toxic disasters and severe flooding devastated the countryside. Those forced to live on city streets fare no better. The homeless are as likely to be attacked by a swarm of devil rats as they are to be beaten by a ganger looking for a bit of fun.

The Survival skill is used for braving all forms of extreme outdoor conditions—this includes urban survival, where the threats are as likely to come from other people as they are from the elements. It covers the ability to find food, water, and temporary shelter in any environment. If you’re exposed to these conditions for 24 hours or more, you’ll need to start making daily `Survival + Willpower [Mental] Tests`. Modifiers and thresholds for Survival Tests are provided on the Survival Test Table. If you fail the test, you don’t find the food or shelter you need and take Stun damage with a Damage Value equal to twice the threshold step. The Stun damage cannot be healed until you get a good night’s sleep without having to make a Survival Test. If your Stun Condition Monitor overflows and you fall unconscious, you cannot make your Survival Tests, so you just keep taking the damage (now Physical from overflow) until you’re either rescued or dead.

**Survival Test Table**

| **WILDERNESS TERRAIN**              | **THRESHOLD** | **STUN DAMAGE ON FAIL** |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------- |
| Mild (forest, plains, urban)        | 6             | 2                       |
| Moderate (foothills, jungle, swamp) | 12            | 4                       |
| Tough (desert, high mountains)      | 18            | 6                       |
| Extreme (Arctic, Antarctic)         | 30+           | 10+                     |
| **SITUATION**                       | **MODIFIER**  | -                       |
| Camping/survival gear on hand       | +2            | -                       |
| No food or water                    | –2            | -                       |

| Inappropriate clothing/armor        | –1 to –4      | -                       |
| Extended travel or exertion         | –1 to –4      | -                       |
| Toxic terrain                       | –2 to –4      | -                       |
| Character injured                   | -4            | -                       |
| **WEATHER**                         | **MODIFIER**  | -                       |

##### SWIMMING (STRENGTH)

This skill determines the character’s ability to swim in various bodies of water. The skill level affects the distance and speed at which a character can swim. See Using Swimming


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: Athletics
- Specializations: Dash, Long Distance

**USING SWIMMING**

Swimming is a Complex Action. A swimming character can move a number of yards in a Combat Turn equal to the average of their Agility and Strength. You can take a Simple Action to dash with a `Swimming + Strength [Physical] Test`, adding 1 yard per effect, or 2 yards per effect if you’re an elf or a troll. Swimming on the surface of water or under it does not affect this rate of speed. As with the Running skill, swimmers suffer from fatigue after an extended time (Fatigue Damage).

**HOLDING YOUR BREATH**

Sixty seconds (twenty Combat Turns) is the base time a character can hold his breath before any tests are needed. A character needing to hold his breath longer can make a `Swimming + Willpower Test` (with the Controlled Hyperventilation specialization coming into play if you have it). Each net hit extends the clock by 15 seconds (5 Combat Turns).

Once the time expires the character must breathe or take 3 of Stun damage at the end of each Combat Turn until they breathe (this damage cannot be resisted). Once all the stun is gone, the character loses consciousness. At this point the character takes 3 physical damage at the end of each Combat Turn until rescued or dead.

**TREADING WATER**

If you’re just trying to keep afloat, you can tread water. You can tread water for a number of minutes equal to your Strength rating. At the end of this time, make a Simple `Swimming + Strength [Physical] (12) Test`. Success means you can keep treading water (or float, if you’re skilled at Swimming) for the same amount of time before another test; failure means you slip and take 3 Stun damage that you can’t resist. If you have a flotation device, double the time between tests. You can keep treading water as long as you can stay conscious.

##### TRACKING (INTUITION)

This skill confers the ability to detect the passage of metahumans and other game through terrain and use those clues to follow that individual. This skill also allows you to identify unmarked trails and common game paths is various environments. See Using Tracking.


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: Outdoors
- Specializations: Desert, Forest, Jungle, Mountain, Polar, Urban, another terrain type

**USING TRACKING**

Tracking a person or critter requires a `Tracking + Intuition [Mental] Test` with a threshold based on the terrain (decided by the gamemaster using the TN table). If the target is actively obscuring their trail, tracking is handled as an Opposed Test. The tracker rolls `Tracking + Intuition [Mental]` against the target’s `Sneak + Agility [Physical]`. Any effect on a Tracking Test can be used to gain additional information about the trail, such as the number of people using the trail, type of critters recently using it, and how old the tracks are. In urban tracking, additional effect can be used to identify local crowd movement patterns, relevant cameras, and AR clues that reveal where the target was heading and how long ago it passed by. The gamemaster may choose to apply modifiers for conditions such as weather, age of the tracks, the amount of people who’ve trampled the trail, and so on. Individuals using a tracking dog or other tracking critter may use Animal Handling as a Teamwork Test for their animal’s Tracking Test.

#### Social Active Skills

Dice rarely need to get involved when characters need to solve problems between one another. Dealing with NPCs isn’t always so easy. Social skills give characters the ability to problem-solve without expending bullets or mana. These skills tend to be linked to the Charisma attribute

Social skills are intended to be used to complement good role-playing, not replace it. The Social Test should come either at the end of a well-role-played scene to wrap it up, or in place of a social situation that would be less interesting to actually play through to get through it quickly. The gamemaster can provide modifiers on this test based on how well you make your point, or how much bulldrek you’re able to pile up without flinching.

**Social Skill Test Lookup Table**

| **CHARACTER ROLL**                | **TARGET ROLL**                 |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Con + Charisma [Social]           | Con + Charisma [Social]         |
| Etiquette + Charisma [Social]     | Perception + Charisma [Social]  |
| Impersonation + Charisma [Social] | Perception + Intuition [Mental] |

| Performance + Charisma [Social]   | Charisma + Willpower            |

##### CON (CHARISMA)

Con governs the ability to manipulate or fool an NPC during a social encounter. This skill covers a range of confidence games as well as the principles behind those cons.


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: Acting
- Specializations: Fast Talking, Seduction

##### ETIQUETTE (CHARISMA)

Etiquette represents the level of understanding and awareness of proper social rituals. The skill works as a sort of social version of Sneak, allowing you to move unimpeded through various social situations. Etiquette also serves as a social safety net in case a player botches a social situation in a way a skilled character would not. See Using Etiquette.


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: Influence
- Specializations: By culture or subculture (Corporate, High Society, Media, Mercenary, Street, Yakuza, etc.)

**USING ETIQUETTE**

Etiquette is about blending into the social fabric. Skilled characters can move through a social situation without anyone realizing that they don’t belong. It’s more than knowing the right mores (you could look those up on the Matrix), it’s about trained instinct.

You can use Etiquette to ease suspicions, so that people might trust you more than they would an outsider. Make an `Etiquette + Charisma [Social] Test` against the other person’s `Perception + Charisma [Social] Opposed Test`. If you get you roll higher, they’ll accept you. If you get 3 or more net effect, their attitude toward you will improve, moving up a line on the “NPC’s attitude” section of the Social Modifiers table.

The skill is not meant to replace role-playing, but it can save you from a social blunder that you (the player) make when your character probably wouldn’t have. When this happens, make an Etiquette Test against a threshold equal to the severity of the blunder (set by the gamemaster). A successful test means your character recovers from the misstep.

When making Etiquette tests with a group of NPCs, use the same rules for influencing groups (Using Social Skills).

A glitch on an Etiquette Test is treated the same as a social blunder—the temporary annoyance could give you a –2 modifier on your next social test. Critical glitches result in major social gaffes that have a lasting effect on the relationship your character has with others—the NPC’s stance towards your character could move one step toward Enemy. This is the stuff of which long-time grudges and major feuds are made, the words of disrespect that set street armies into motion.

##### IMPERSONATION (CHARISMA)

Impersonation is the ability to assume the identity of another person, including voice and physical mannerisms. The skill is limited by the physical abilities of the character. A dwarf might be able to impersonate a troll over a commlink, but the illusion shatters when he is face to face with his target.


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: Acting
- Specializations: By metahuman type (Dwarf, Elf, Human, Ork, Troll)

##### INSTRUCTION (CHARISMA)

Instruction governs the ability to teach people. The skill level helps determine how comfortable the instructor is delivering new material as well as how complex of a skill may be taught. See Using Instruction.


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: None
- Specializations: By Active or Knowledge skill category (Combat, Language, Magical, Academic Knowledge, Street Knowledge, etc.)

**USING INSTRUCTION**

From virtual instructors to how-to vids, there are numerous ways to learn skills. There is no substitute, however, for a flesh-and-blood instructor. In order to teach someone a skill, a character must have the skill at Rating 2 or higher. The teacher can only teach up to their own Instruction Rating. Teaching is an `Instruction + Charisma [Social] Test`. Every effect on the Teaching Test reduces the time for the student to improve their skill by a day (Character Advancement).

Instruction is also used to teach spells, complex forms, rituals, and various other techniques. The rules for using Instruction are a bit different in these cases and are explained in the appropriate sections of this book


##### INTIMIDATION (CHARISMA)

Intimidation is about creating the impression that you are more menacing than another person in order to get them to do what you want. The skill may be applied multiple ways, from negotiation to interrogation. Intimidation is an Opposed `Intimidation + Charisma [Social]` Test against the target’s `Charisma + Willpower`, modified by the appropriate entries on the Social Modifiers Table.


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: None
- Specializations: Interrogation, Mental, Physical, Torture

##### LEADERSHIP (CHARISMA)

Leadership is the ability to direct and motivate others. It’s like Con, except rather than using deception you’re using a position of authority. This skill is especially helpful in situations where the will of a teammate is shaken or someone is being asked to do something uncomfortable. The Leadership skill is not meant to replace or make up for poor teamwork. When using Leadership make an opposed test `Charisma + Leadership`. See Using Social Influence Skills, for test modifiers.


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: Influence
- Specializations: Command, Direct, Inspire, Rally

**USING LEADERSHIP**

The Leadership skill is about coaxing, convincing, threatening, or challenging your subordinates, or getting people to accept you as a superior. If you lead people who accept you as their (lone) superior, even temporarily, you can take a Complex Action to make a `Leadership + Charisma [Social] Test`. How this helps depends on what you choose to do.

Command: The target resists with a `Leadership + Willpower [Mental] test` (with Social Modifiers). For every net hit you get, the target accepts you as their leader for 1 Combat Turn. This doesn’t work if you’ve failed on this target before.

Direct: Your effect act as a Teamwork Test for one subordinate’s skill or Composure Test that they perform on or before their next Turn.

Inspire: Your effect act as a Teamwork Test for your subordinates’ Surprise Test for the rest of the Combat Turn.

Rally: Your subordinates add 1 to their Initiative Score for every 2 effect you get.

##### NEGOTIATION (CHARISMA)

Negotiation governs a character’s ability to apply their charisma, tactics, and knowledge of situational psychology in order to create a better position when making deals.


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: Influence
- Specializations: Bargaining, Contracts, Diplomacy

##### PERFORMANCE (CHARISMA)

This skill governs the ability to execute a performing art. Performance is to the arts what Artisan is to craft. The performer uses her skill to entertain or even captivate an audience. See Using Performance.


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: Acting
- Specializations: By performance art (Presentation, Acting, Comedy, specific Musical Instrument, etc.)

**USING PERFORMANCE**

Performance is a Simple Test with a Social limit—the gamemaster can use your effect to gauge the artistry of your performance. If you’re trying distract a target, or sweep them up in your performance, the generic modifiers on the Social Modifiers Table apply, and your target(s) use their `Charisma + Willpower` to oppose your test.

Cybertechnology is the ability to create, maintain, and repair cybernetic parts. A character with the proper tools and parts may repair or even build new cybernetics. Cybertechnology is not a surgical skill. Characters cannot attach or re-attach cybernetics to organic material with this skill. This skill may be used to modify or upgrade cybernetics within cyberlimbs. See Building and Repairing

- Default: No
- Skill Group: Biotech
- Specializations: Bodyware, Cyberlimbs, Headware, Repair

Providing the user has the proper equipment, the skill can be used to manipulate or even take over the signal of any item’s communication system. See Using Electronic Warfare

- Default: No
- Skill Group: Cracking
- Specializations: Communications, Encryption, Jamming, Sensor Operations

##### FIRST AID (LOGIC)

- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: Biotech
- Specializations: By treatment (Gunshot Wounds, Resuscitation, Broken Bones, Burns, etc.)

##### FORGERY (LOGIC)

Forgery is used to produce counterfeit items or alter existing items to a specific purpose. Depending on the type of forgery, the forger may need specific tools or schematics to complete the task. See Using Forgery

- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: None
- Specializations: Counterfeiting, Credstick Forgery, False ID, Image Doctoring, Paper Forgery

**USING FORGERY**

Talented forgers can simulate anything from a signature to a credstick to the Mona Lisa. The skill is most often used for doctoring hardcopy IDs, signatures, and official paperwork, but it can be used to fabricate anything you can imagine and your skill level can handle. Creating a forgery is a `Forgery + Logic Test`. The limit for this test is either Physical (for forged art, signatures,and other physical objects) or Mental (for credsticks, documents, and other items that are more data than substance). Your dice pool is adjusted by appropriate modifiers (see the Build/Repair Table for suggestions), and given a time requirement by the gamemaster (an interval from the Extended Test Difficulties table is fine).

The quality of the forgery is based on the number of hits scored on the test. This number acts as the threshold for attempts to spot the fake. Anyone examining a forgery makes an Opposed Test using a `Perception + Intuition [Mental]` Test or `Forgery + Intuition [Mental]` Test. If they score as many or more hits than the quality of the forgery, the item is exposed as a fake.

Data-based forgeries, like credsticks, documents, and SINs, don’t really hold up well to scrutiny, what with information being so readily available. They can appear almost identical to the original, but any attempt to get it to act like the original (transfer nuyen, pass a SIN check, etc.) reveals the forgery.

##### HACKING (LOGIC)

Hacking is used to discover and exploit security flaws in computers and other electronics. For more on how Hacking is used, see Using Hacking

- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: Cracking
- Specializations: Devices, Files, Hosts, Personas

- Default: No
- Skill Group: Engineering
- Specializations: Motorboat, Sailboat, Ship, Submarine

##### NAVIGATION (INTUITION)

Navigation governs the use of technology and natural instinct to navigate through territory. This skill enables characters to read maps, use GPS devices, follow AR nav points, or follow a course by landmarks or general direction sense. Navigation applies to both AR and non-AR-enhanced environments.

- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: Outdoors
- Specializations: Augmented Reality Markers, Celestial, Compass, Maps, GPS

**USING NAVIGATION**

Since the advent of AR mapping, a walk through the sprawl never requires a test, but getting from A to B can be a lot tougher when the Matrix isn’t pointing the way. Navigation tests are required when you’re traversing unmarked or highly unfamiliar terrain, such as someone new to Seattle attempting to navigate the Ork Underground. It’s a Simple Navigation + Intuition [Mental] Test, with a threshold based on the terrain, taking into account modifiers for environmental factors such as poor visibility, landmarks, existing trails, advice from locals, and so on—your gamemaster will give you a tn

##### SOFTWARE (LOGIC)

Software is the skill used to create and manipulate programming in the Matrix. See Using Software.

- Default: No
- Skill Group: Electronics
- Specializations: Data Bombs or by complex form (Editor, Resonance Spike, Tattletale, etc.)

##### BUILDING & REPAIRING

Building or repairing an object is an Extended Test that the gamemaster may decide requires certain tools or facilities. Modifiers from the Build/Repair Table /should be applied to the test. Characters electing to design new items must have the appropriate Knowledge skills to conceptualize and create schematics. The gamemaster assigns a threshold and interval for the Extended Test using the Task Difficulty Table

**Build and Repair Table**

## Chapter 7: Equipment

### Shadowrun Economy

### Nuyen

{{Put details here}}

### Buying Gear

Gear’s Availability Rating determines how easy (or hard, or practically impossible) it is to acquire a needed or desired piece of equipment. Availability is an abstract amalgamation of factors like rarity, legality, distribution issues, supply, demand, and so on. The letter that follows an item’s numerical Availability Rating shows whether the item is Restricted (R) or Forbidden (F). For this reason, the gamemaster should feel free to modify an item’s Availability Rating—either the numerical value, or its legality code—in situations that would warrant it, like if the strider is in a war zone or in a country with a restricted economy.

Standard gear is generally available in most places. In locations where it is not you can roll `3D6 + Streetwise VS (Availability + 10)` to see if you can find the items. You must roll for Restricted items, and Forbidden Items you will generally need a Contact to get your hands on those. 

#### Standard Gear

Standard items with no Availability rating can be purchased at your local WalMart, Starbucks, or Electronics Store, or perhaps ordered online or picked up from a vending machine. All you have to do is pay the cost listed in the book for the item (with adjustments from the gamemaster if she wants, according to local market fluctuations or other extenuating circumstances she deems appropriate).

While easy to buy, standard goods are eminently traceable. Records of legal purchases are almost always kept, shared, and cross-indexed; whether this datatrail gets stuck to your fake ID or, worse, a real one, it’s a potential liability. Purchasing habits are valuable to marketing companies, so you’ll start seeing AR advertisements tailored to what you buy and what you like. And since Big Brother Commerce is watching, remember that the Net host that knows and remembers your favorite store to buy sneakers at isn’t necessarily as secure as your commlink. Fake IDs can be used to shield yourself from this pervasive data-mining, but as long as you’re on the grid, even fake IDs will accumulate profiles of their own after long-term use. And there’s always the chance someone can find out more about you than you want to let go.

Of course, standard goods can also be purchased on the black market to avoid traceability, but the gamemaster may decide that the latest copy of Miracle Shooter is more expensive with the digital serial numbers filed off and apply a surcharge for your paranoia.

#### Starting Gear

Like it says in character creation, starting characters may not purchase items with a rating greater than 6 or an Availability greater than 12 during character creation. You don’t need to worry about your purchases at character creation going on some kind of permanent record (although there are some qualities you can take that would). Once the game is on, you can beg, borrow, and steal whatever gear you can get your grubby little hands on—at least, you can certainly try.

### Gear Ratings

Every item described in this chapter includes a set of statistics. Every item has a cost along with an Availability Rating, and most non-weapon, non-armor items, except those that simply confer an ability or don’t, have an overall Rating, usually between 1 and 6. Often a gear’s Cost and Availability are functions of its Rating.

**Accuracy**: Refers to a weapon’s overall accuracy. A firearm’s Accuracy acts as the limit for tests involving that weapon, capping the number of Effect that can be achieved on an attack roll using it.

**Ammo**: Refers to the amount of ammunition a ranged weapon can hold, followed by the method of reloading in parentheses: (b) means break action, (c) means detachable external box magazine, or “clip” in modern street parlance, (d) means drum, (ml) means muzzle-loader, (m) means internal magazine, (cy) means cylinder, and (belt) means belt-fed.

**Armor**: Each piece of armor has an Armor value that adds to the wearer’s Damage Resistance (see Armor).

**Armor Penetration**: All weapons have an Armor Penetration value, although in some cases, this value is listed with no value, meaning no AP. The AP value indicates how a weapon interacts with armor (see Armor Penetration). This is the amount of Armor protection that is ignored by the weapon. It had no effect on Toughness, the only things that ignore Toughness are Special Damage types. 

**Availability**: The higher the Availability of an item, the more difficult and costly it is to get it (see Buying Gear). Gear without an Availability rating can be bought at an appropriate local store or ordered online without any trouble. The letter that follows an item’s numerical Availability rating shows whether the item is Restricted (R) or Forbidden (F). Items without a letter in parentheses are considered legal—they aren’t necessarily easy to find, but you won’t ever get arrested for seeking them.

**Blast**: This rating is possessed by grenades, missiles, rockets, and other area-of-effect weapons. Blast is the amount the blast weapon’s damage value is reduced per yard of distance from the explosion’s point of origin (see Blast Effects).

**Capacity**: Some sensor packages and cyberware can be equipped with a range of subsystems. A Capacity value is listed for these, indicating the maximum amount of “slots” worth of accessories the item can hold. If the Capacity is listed in brackets, it’s the cost of that subsystem or accessory, or the number of slots that item takes up. Some cyberware items with a Capacity cost can also be installed as standalone items (taking up Essence) rather than subsystems (taking up Capacity); if both costs are listed, only one applies, depending on whether you installed it in another item or in yourself.

**Concealability Modifier**: This indicates how easy it is to hide a given item, and is applied as a modifier to Perception + Intuition Tests to spot the item (see Concealing Gear).

**Cost**: This is the base price a character must pay to buy the item. If the item is legal, this is the standard price found at stores or online. Note that rare and/or illegal items may cost less or more depending on certain black market variations (see (Il)legality). Cost is also subject to local supply and demand, so the gamemaster should feel free to adjust it accordingly for certain settings.

**Damage Value (DV)**: A weapon’s Damage Value represents the base amount of harm, in points of damage, it causes when it hits a target. Damage Values consist of a number (the the base damage) and a letter indicating the type of damage caused: P for Physical, S for Stun. A parenthetical annotation following the damage type, such as (f) or (e), indicates that the damage is flechette or electrical (see Damage).

**Device Rating**: The Device Rating determines the overall quality and effectiveness of a device, from a stimulant patch to a commlink.

**Essence Cost**: All cyberware and bioware implants have an Essence Cost, representing the reduction of the character’s Essence rating that occurs when the augmentation is implanted.

**Mode**: A firearm’s firing mode indicates the rate of fire it is capable of. Some weapons have more than one mode available, so characters may switch between them (see Firearms). The firing modes are: SS (single-shot), SA (semi-automatic), BF (burst fire), and FA (full auto).

**Mounts**: There are several places where a weapon accessory can be attached to a firearm: underbarrel, barrel, or top-mount. Only one accessory can be attached to a particular mount. Integral accessories (those that come with the weapon) don’t take up mount locations. Hold-outs don’t have mounts. Pistols, machine pistols, and SMGs do not have an underbarrel mount, just top and barrel mounts. All rifles and heavy weapons have all three types of mounts. Projectile weapons can only take accessories designed for them specifically.

**Reach**: Melee weapons may have a Reach rating, the default value is 1. Meaning you can hit any target within 1 yard. This equates to one square on a combat grid, so within 1 square of you. Each rating over extends the reach of the weapon by 1 square.

**Recoil Compensation (RC)**: This lists the amount of recoil compensation a firearm has to offer, reducing the modifiers from a weapon’s recoil (see Recoil). Numbers in parentheses refer to full recoil compensation that applies only when all integral accessories are deployed (folding or detachable stocks and so forth).

> Why isn't range listed? Because its a dumb concept in a TTRPG. I can hit a target with an AR-15 at almost a mile out. Basically if I can see it, its in range. Thats why. I love Gygax as much as the next guy but a Longbow fired by a professional can hit a target at a 100 yards easily which is also within site.

#### Melee Weapon Descriptions

**BLADES**
---

Use the Blades skill to wield these weapons. Combat axe: A two-handed tungsten-alloy monster, available single- or double-bladed. A hardened thrusting point can be concealed, spring-loaded, in the handle. While it may seem barbaric or primitive, the physical augmentations of 2075 can make an old-school weapon like a combat axe even deadlier than a firearm in the right hands. So go ahead, go medieval.

Combat knife: A long, KA-BAR-style fighting knife with a blacked-out blade and a chisel point for punching through armor.

Forearm snap-blades: These are essentially like spurs, only they’re external—painless to install or remove. A forearm sheath conceals three blades that can be extended or retracted via wireless link or muscle movement commands.

Wireless: Readying the forearm snap blades is a Free Action instead of a Simple Action.

Katana: The legendary two-handed sword of the samurai. The katana has become synonymous not just with street samurai, but with shadowrunners in general, at least in the trids; they’ve got everyone packing a katana, from the decker to the mage. But being a silly cliché doesn’t make this blade any less dangerous, or less helpful in a fight.

Knife: Your basic, all-purpose street cutter. It comes in a bewildering array of styles, colors, and flavors, but the statistics don’t vary from one to the next. Ordinary knives are used by the poor, the desperate, or the cautious as backup weapons.

Pole arm: This is, at its very essence, a blade on the end of a very long stick. It usually features an axe-head, glaive, spear point, or similar maiming implement. It’s not easy to handle and it’s just about impossible to conceal, but it’s popular both with trolls and with melee combatants looking to safely keep said large trolls at more than arm’s length.

Survival knife: A fine quality blade—smooth on one edge, serrated on the other—with several accessories, including a GPS monitor, mini-multitool, micro-lighter, and a hidden compartment in the handle. The sides of the steel are coated with a non-toxic chemical that blacks out the blade when inert to prevent unwanted reflection, but can be activated to provide two hours of phosphorescent light. All knives can cut flesh, but a survival knife is better at cutting rope and wood, or otherwise being used as a tool. The survival knife is the kind of gadget that no professional should be without. Wireless: The knife displays an ARO of local maps, your GPS position, and can be used to make commcalls.

Sword: It’s sharp, it’s heavy, and it will fragging cut you wide open. Available in a wide variety of styles (wakizashi, seax, scimitar, jian, machete, and so on and so forth), this one-handed blade is not as formidable as a katana but is substantially easier to hide.

**CLUBS**
---

Use the Clubs skill to inflict blunt force trauma with these weapons.

Club: The weapon they named the skill after. These stats represent a range of objects, including an axe handle, baseball bat, wrench, crowbar, a tire iron, and a two-by-four with a rusty nail in it. There is a price listed, but it’s not overly difficult to find one for free if you know where to look.

Extendable baton: This telescoping club can be collapsed, and it can be extended with a sharp flick of the wrist or a wireless signal. When retracted, it’s more easily concealed (Concealability Modifier 0 when retracted, +2 when extended). Wireless: Readying the extendable baton is a Free Action instead of a Simple Action.

Sap: Also called a blackjack, this is a small, springy club, or a flat piece of iron in a flexible leather covering. It’s specially designed for concealment (Concealability Modifier –2).

Staff: This large, heavy stick is popular with magicians going for that traditional look. Available in composite, hardwood, high-carbon steel, and other materials.

Stun baton: A standard riot-control weapon, viewed as a tool and symbol of corporate-government oppressors but pragmatically useful to runners. It has ten charges and regains one charge per ten seconds when plugged in. Wireless: The stun baton recharges by induction, regaining one charge per full hour of wireless-enabled time.

Telescoping staff: This is a metal and composite staff that can telescope down to a reasonable size, one that can be concealed about as easily as a stun baton or a sword. It can be extended and locked in place by whirling it at the correct speed and angle and twisting the grip, or via a wireless signal. Wireless: Readying the telescoping staff is a Free Action instead of a Simple Action.

**BOWS**
---

Bows: This could be a traditional longbow of fiberglass or wood, or possibly a modern compound-and-pulley bow. Both are archaic and rare weapons on the streets of 2075, and both have the advantage of being hacker- proof. Reloading a bow takes a Simple Action (Ready Weapon).

Bows have ratings that indicate the minimum Strength you need to use that weapon. When attacking with a bow, a character whose Strength is less than the Strength minimum suffers a –3 modifier per point below the minimum; this penalty reflects the difficulty they have in pulling the bow and nocking an arrow. The weapon’s Rating is also used to determine its range and damage (maximum Rating is 10). Use the lowest value of your Strength, the bow’s rating, or the arrow Rating for range and damage when attacking a target, because your average Rating 10 titanium-sheathed beryllium-alloy bow tends to turn wood or fiberglass arrows into powder when they hit a target.

Crossbows: Modern crossbows are equipped with automatic reloading devices, so unless you’re using a museum piece, reloading doesn’t require a Ready Weapon action. Crossbows have internal magazines (m) holding up to 4 bolts. Crossbows are available in Light, Medium, and Heavy sizes.

Injection arrow/bolt: An injection bolt causes the same damage as a regular arrow or bolt, but also includes a payload of one dose of a drug or toxin. Effects depend on the drug payload, but to successfully deliver it, the attack must deal at least one box of damage after the Damage Resistance Test. This is an injection vector toxin attack.

Throwing knives/shuriken: A wide variety of shapes and sizes of aerodynamically balanced, specially weighted, muscle-powered throwing weapons are available, from throwing spikes to darts to kunai and shuriken. A character can ready (Agility ÷ 2) of these knives with one Ready Weapon action.

Wireless: If all the throwing knives or shuriken you throw in a single Combat Turn are wireless and you have a smartlink system, each knife you throw receives a +1 bonus per knife thrown that Combat Turn at your current target, as the knives inform and adjust for wind and other atmospheric conditions. So you’d get no bonus on the first throw, a +1 bonus on the second throw, a +2 bonus on the third throw, etc. (assuming you aimed all three knives at the same target).

#### Firearm Descriptions

Cold steel that spits hot lead. Slug-throwing firearms are by far the most common weapons on the streets of 2075. Each weapon is chambered to take either old-fashioned cased ammunition or caseless ammo. Most firearms load caseless ammunition, with fewer and fewer models coming in variants able to handle cased ammunition. Sure, releasing a storm of shell casings when you hold down the trigger looks awesome, but it’s impractical for the modern shadowrunner and their natural enemy, law enforcement and corporate security.

Firearms come with wireless capability and a digital ammunition counter. Ammunition is sold separately. All firearms have the following wireless bonuses in addition to any wireless bonuses on each model: 

**Wireless**: The weapon displays an ARO that tells you ammo levels and ammo type loaded. If you have a DNI, you get two additional benefits. First, ejecting a clip (for weapons that have them) is a Free Action rather than a Simple Action. Second, changing fire modes (on models that have more than one) is a Free Action rather than a Simple Action.

**TASERS**
---

Tasers are legal to carry and a great choice for non-lethally incapacitating someone. Tasers, like other electrical weapons, have a flat Armor Penetration value of –5 and deal electricity damage. Use the Pistols skill to fire a taser. Tasers can take only top-mounted accessories.

Defiance EX Shocker: This heavy-duty taser fires up to 4 darts that trail wires up to 20 yards long. The wired connection to the battery allows for a more powerful shock. Most modern tasers use wireless darts, so the Defiance EX Shocker is an exception. It also features contacts that allow it to be used as a stun weapon in melee (Accuracy 3, DV 8S(e), Reach 0). Wireless: A successful hit informs you of the status of the target’s basic health (and Condition Monitors).

Yamaha Pulsar: The darts of this taser contain wireless capacitors, meaning that the Pulsar eliminates the need for cumbersome wires. As a trade-off, it is slightly less powerful than the EX Shocker, although it can fire faster. It lacks the EX Shocker’s melee contacts. Wireless: A successful hit informs you of the status of the target’s basic health (and Condition Monitors).

**HOLD-OUTS**
---

Hold-out pistols are very concealable and are perfect for sneaking into a meet or wearing as a back-up piece. They don’t have much else going for them, being both weak and inaccurate. Use the Pistols skill when firing a hold-out pistol. Hold-outs can’t take accessories. 

Fichetti Tiffani Needler: Designed to appeal to social climbers and debutantes, the Tiffani Needler is available in a wide variety of colors and styles. It also has a special color-changing coating that can be manipulated via wireless signal. This is useful to make sure your gun matches with your shoes or your handbag. The Needler can only fire flechette rounds (already factored into its damage code). Wireless: You can change the color of the Tiffani Needler with a Simple Action. 

Streetline Special: Popular among society’s dregs, the Streetline Special is a small, lightweight weapon made of composite materials. Magnetic Anomaly Detectors suffer a –2 modifier to detect it.

Walther Palm Pistol: This is a classic double-barreled derringer in an over-under barrel combination. It packs a punch for its size, but on the downside it has one of the most diminutive “magazine” capacities on the market— just one bullet per barrel. Both barrels can be fired at once as a short burst.

**LIGHT PISTOLS**

Light pistols are highly accurate and fairly concealable, occupying a comfortable middle ground between Hold-outs and Heavy Pistols. They’re extremely common on the streets. Use the Pistols skill when firing a light pistol. Light pistols can take top- and barrel- mounted accessories.

Ares Light Fire 75: Designed based on one of the most common pistols on the market, the Light Fire is a weapon for special operators, not commonly available through legal channels. A special barrel-mounted silencer developed exclusively for the Light Fire comes attached, applying an additional –1 modifier to the modifier usually provided by silencers. In addition to its integral silencer, the Ares Light Fire 75 includes a smartgun system.

Ares Light Fire 70: The Ares Light Fire 70 is one of the most common pistols on the market. A special barrel-mounted silencer developed exclusively for the Light Fire 70 is available that gives you an additional –1 modifier to the usual –4 (for a total of –5); this silencer costs 750¥.

Beretta 201T: This light sidearm is used by many security professionals. It is capable of burst fire. Since the 201T is classified as a light pistol without further limitations, it is quite popular with security agencies in countries where heavy pistols and machine pistols are hard to come by legally. Semi-automatic bursts using the Beretta 201T require a Simple Action. The weapon includes a detachable shoulder stock.

Colt America L36: A venerable pistol with a great reputation. This basic firearm is cheap, easily concealed, and nearly ubiquitous. A perfect throwaway weapon.

Fichetti Security 600: A light sidearm for security forces, this weapon’s highly efficient feeding mechanism allows it a thirty-round magazine. The Fichetti Security 600 comes with a detachable folding stock and laser sight

Taurus Omni-6: This reliable, rugged revolver is specially designed to handle a wide variety of ammunition. Popular with hobbyists and hand-loaders, the Omni-6 comes with some interchangeable cylinders so it can take either cased or caseless, light pistol or heavy pistol ammo. When firing light pistol rounds, the Omni-6 is semi-automatic (SA) and has a base DV of 6P, and when it fires heavy pistol ammo it has only single shot mode (SS), and a base DV of 7P and –1 AP. The Omni-6 includes an integral laser sight.

**HEAVY PISTOLS**
---

Heavy pistols are powerful sidearms that are a good compromise between concealability and firepower. When you shoot a heavy pistol, you use the Pistols skill. Heavy pistols can take top- and barrel- mounted accessories

Ares Predator V: The newest iteration of the most popular handgun in the world, especially with mercenaries and shadowrunners. Upgraded with improved ergonomics and handling features, the Ares Predator V includes a smartgun system. Some say that the Ares Predator V isn’t better than other guns in its class, but no one can argue that it has better brand recognition.

Ares Viper Slivergun: The sleek Slivergun pairs the undeniably winning combo of burst-fire capability and built-in sound suppression (an integral silencer) with its large magazine capacity. It fires metal slivers that count as flechette ammunition, which is factored into the weapon’s damage code.

Browning Ultra-Power: This venerable sidearm is the Ares Predator’s primary competition as the world’s toughest heavy pistol. It offers a built-in top-mounted laser sight and is slightly cheaper

Colt Government 2066: This government-issue weapon, styled after the legendary Colt M1911a1, uses an electrically induced spark to detonate the bullet’s propellants. The removal of most moving parts from the firing mechanism gives this weapon a reputation for being exceptionally reliable.

Remington Roomsweeper: This is really more of a short-barreled shotgun than a pistol. When loaded with shot rounds (flechette) rather than solid slugs, it uses Heavy Pistol ranges but shotgun rules

Ruger Super Warhawk: This revolver is as loud as a jet liner and twice as shiny. It’s also one of the scariest handguns in the world. The cased ammo variant is popular for the sheer thrill of swinging open the cylinder gate one handed and dumping spent brass 

**MACHINE PISTOLS**
---

Machine pistols offer a high rate of fire in a compact package. Use the Automatics skill to fire a machine pistol (characters may use the Pistols skill in Semi-Auto mode). Machine pistols can take top- and barrel-mounted accessories.

Ares Crusader II: A large magazine and easy handling make the Ares Crusader II one of the most popular weapons of its class. It features an integral barrel-mounted gas-vent 2 recoil compensation system and comes with an integral smartgun system.

Ceska Black Scorpion: This classic machine pistol provides concealable burst-fire capability. It comes equipped with an integral folding stock.

Steyr TMP: This lightweight polymer-frame pistol is capable of full autofire, but its light weight makes it hard to control when firing on full auto. It comes equipped with a built-in top-mounted laser sight.

**SUBMACHINE GUNS**
---

Use the Automatics skill when firing a submachine gun.
SMGs can take top- and barrel-mounted accessories.

Colt Cobra TZ–120: With its unique design and wide range of accessories, the Colt Cobra series is quite popular both among security forces the world over and on the trids. The TZ–120 comes with a folding stock, top-mounted laser sight, and a barrel-mounted gas-vent 2 system.

FN P93 Praetor: This bullpup submachine gun was purpose-built for Corporate Court-controlled Interpol fast-response teams. Its special chamber system provides 1 point of Recoil Compensation, it has an integrated rigid stock, and a flashlight that can be used to reduce darkness penalties by one step (Environmental Modifiers). Possession of the FN P93 while not a legitimate member of a Corporate Court force is a crime in most jurisdictions.

HK–227: The SMG of choice for many corporate and military security forces, the HK–227 boasts a retractable stock, smartgun system, and integral sound suppressor

Ingram Smartgun X: Grade-A bang bang. Famous as the weapon of choice for many legendary street samurai since the 2050s, the Ingram Smartgun comes tricked out with a gas-vent 2 system, a smartgun system, and an integral sound suppressor

SCK Model 100: Shin Chou Kyogo is synonymous with Japanese corporate security. Nearly every Japanacorp’s security forces are issued the SCK 100, including Renraku’s infamous Red Samurai. The SCK 100 features an internal smartgun system and a folding stock.

Uzi IV: This aging submachine gun is a worthy descendant of the famous Israeli weapon. The SMG features an integral folding stock and built-in top-mounted laser sight.

**ASSAULT RIFLES**
---

Use the Automatics skill when firing an assault rifle. Assault rifles can take top-, barrel-, and underbarrel- mounted accessories.

AK-97: The AK-97 is a legendary weapon with storied reliability—you can bury it for ten years, dig it up, and fire it immediately without a single problem. When all of the nano-fabricated AK–174s melted to slag, the AK-97s kept functioning just fine.

Ares Alpha: Specially designed for Ares Firewatch special forces, the Alpha has since become a multi-platinum best-selling success the world over, seeing use with UCAS Special Forces. In part, this is due to its exceptional brand awareness, and also because of its underbarrel grenade launcher, smartgun system, and an expensive chamber design that provides 2 points of Recoil Compensation.

Colt M23: This cheap, mass-produced, no-frills assault rifle is loved both by the gangbangers and pirates who can manage to get their hands on one and by the pros who are looking for something to modify from the ground up.

FN HAR: This assault rifle is supremely popular with private security forces and corporate threat-response teams. It features a laser sight and a gas-vent 2 system

Yamaha Raiden: This electronic-firing assault rifle is state-of-the-art. The Raiden is very accurate and is quickly being adopted by japanacorp security forces and the Japanese Imperial Marines. It features an integral sound suppressor and smartgun system, and the electronic firing mechanism and design provides 1 point of Recoil Compensation.


**SNIPER RIFLES**
---

Use the Longarms skill when firing sniper rifles. Firearm enthusiasts will be the first to tell you that sport and hunting rifles are technically not sniper rifles, but they are similar enough in terms of game statistics to be included here rather than in their own section. Sniper rifles can take top, barrel-, and underbarrel-mounted accessories

Ares Desert Strike: This combat-hardened sniper rifle is intended for long-range shooting in harsh environments. That means it was built without materials or technologies prone to failure. It comes equipped with a rigid stock with shock pad and a detachable imaging scope.

Cavalier Arms Crockett EBR: Straddling the line between assault rifle and sniper rifle, the Crockett EBR features a burst fire mode. While it lacks the magazine capacity of a true assault rifle, and lacks the precision of a true marksman’s weapon, it makes up for this in versatility, being able to switch fluidly between a sniping role and a combat role as easy as flipping a switch. It comes equipped with a rigid stock with shock pad and a detachable imaging scope.

Ranger Arms SM–5: A legendary assassin’s weapon, this sniper rifle features a silencer, an imaging scope, and a rigid stock with shock pad. The SM–5 disassembles completely in order to fit into a standard briefcase; setting it up or breaking it down takes an `Extended Firearms + Logic [Mental] (6, Complex Action)` Test. While deadly, the SM–5 is fragile. At the end of every Combat Turn in which the weapon is used in a running firefight, reduce its Accuracy by 1 (to a minimum of 3). If the weapon is used in combat as a melee weapon or to defend from a melee attack, reduce its Accuracy by 2 (again to a minimum of 3). Recalibrating the weapon (a one-hour job) returns its Accuracy to normal.

Remington 950: This high-powered bolt-action hunting rifle features classic wooden furniture and a top-mounted imaging scope that have kept it popular with hunters for several decades. It cannot mount underbarrel accessories.

Ruger 101: This futuristic-looking gas-operated sporting rifle is the favorite weapon for many professional hunters and hobbyists. It features a built-in imaging scope and a rigid stock with shock pad.

**SHOTGUNS**
---

Use the Longarms skill when firing shotguns. The stats for these shotguns are for normal slug rounds. When firing shot, use the special rules for shotguns, choke settings, and flechette ammo (Shotguns). Shotguns can take top, barrel, and underbarrel accessories.

Defiance T–250: A common sight on the mean streets when things escalate beyond pistols and knives, this semi-automatic shotgun is available in either a normal- length or short-barreled version. It is gas operated, but also features a secondary pump action for situations where preventing jams is more important than quickly firing a second shot. The short-barreled version has the Concealability of +4, the range of a heavy pistol, and a damage code of 9P.

Enfield AS-7: This military assault shotgun provides its user with massive firepower. As a close-quarters weapon and general combat gun, it is universally feared. It can either be loaded with ten-round ammo clips or a special twenty-four-round drum. The Enfield AS-7 comes equipped with a built-in, top-mounted laser sight

PJSS Model 55: This is a weapon of classic style for a classic sport. Produced only in small numbers, it’s renowned among European hunters and trap shooters as a precise and prestigious weapon. The weapon’s rigid stock comes equipped with an integrated shock pad. Both barrels can be shot at once as a short burst (see Not Enough Bullets).

**SPECIAL WEAPONS**
---

Use the Exotic Ranged Weapon skill when firing these weapons. This skill is not on the list of skills it can be added **if someone wants to use one of these wacky weapons**.

Ares S-III Super Squirt: This popular non-lethal weapon fires DMSO gel packs. The dimethyl sulfoxide forces the skin to absorb the chemicals the operator wishes to deliver. The attack itself causes no damage, but when the target is hit successfully, the DMSO delivers the substance directly into the target’s bloodstream as a Contact vector toxin (Toxins, Drugs, and BTLs). The Super Squirt uses Light Pistol ranges and can accept top- and underbarrel-mounted accessories

Fichetti Pain Inducer: For a non-lethal weapon, the Fichetti Pain Inducer is not very humane. It makes someone feel like they are in a microwave, roasting from the inside out. Treat this as a toxin attack with a Power of 8 and a speed of Immediate. The target resists with Body + Willpower. If the modified Power exceeds the target’s Mental limit, the target must spend his next Action Phase doing whatever it takes to run away from the pain. The attacker can continue to hold her beam on a target with a Complex Action unless the gamemaster deems the target has dodged away or found cover. If the target cannot get out of the beam, he is incapacitated with pain, suffering a modifier equal to the modified Power on all tests for as long as the beam is trained on him. The Pain Inducer uses SMG ranges and can take top and underbarrel accessories. It has ten charges; when attached to a power point, it reloads one charge every ten seconds. Wireless: The Pain Inducer recharges by induction at a rate of 1 charge per hour

Parashield Dart Pistol: The industry standard dart pistol, this fires injection darts with narcoject or another payload. The Parashield dart pistol uses Heavy Pistol ranges and can take top-mounted accessories. Wireless: The dart reports whether or not it has struck home and successfully injected. It may also report any gross physical anomalies in the target’s tissue, although its medical sensors are not very sophisticated (Device Rating of 1 for the dart).

Parashield Dart Rifle: Originally designed to non-lethally take down large game animals at long ranges, the Parashield dart rifle uses compressed air cartridges to fire injection darts. This weapon includes a top-mounted imaging scope. It uses sporting rifle ranges and can mount top and underbarrel accessories. Wireless: The dart reports whether or not it has struck home and successfully injected. It may also report any gross physical anomalies in the target’s tissue, although its medical sensors are not very sophisticated (Device Rating of 1 for the dart).

**MACHINE GUNS**
---

Machine guns come in three varieties—light, medium, and heavy—that determine their ranges. All, even the “light” ones, are in fact very heavy and large. A light machine gun is physically bigger and heavier than an assault rifle. MMGs and HMGs could be carried by someone with Strength of 8+ and 10+ (respectively), but they work better as vehicle-mounted weapons.

Use the Heavy Weapons skill when firing these weapons. They suffer from double modifiers for uncompensated recoil (Recoil). Machine guns can take top, barrel, and underbarrel accessories.

Ingram Valiant: This legendary light machine gun is popular with mercenary units the world over. It comes with a rigid stock with shock pad, a laser sight, and a barrel-mounted gas-vent 2 system.

Stoner-Ares M202: This MMG packs a tremendous punch into a relatively lightweight framework made of extra-durable compounds. Due to its relatively small size, it’s a very popular secondary weapon for heavy military vehicles. Trolls with no concept of subtlety sometimes deck them out with accessories for use as personal weapons.

RPK HMG: This heavy Russian machine gun is used by the militaries of several eastern European and Near East countries, primarily as a vehicle-mounted support weapon. Equipped with a detachable tripod, the RPK is usually fired from a prone, sitting, or kneeling position when not mounted on a vehicle.

**CANNONS & LAUNCHERS**
---

Use the Heavy Weapons skill when firing assault cannons and grenade and missile launchers. All suffer from double modifiers for uncompensated recoil. Both assault cannons and launchers can take top and underbarrel accessories. Naturally, assault cannons use assault cannon ammo, grenade launchers fire minigrenades, and missile launchers launch missiles or rockets.

Ares Antioch–2: The Antioch–2 features a classic grenade launcher design combined with an integral smartlink system. It is one of the more affordable grenade launchers on the market. Wireless: You can use the wireless link trigger for your grenades, even if you don’t have DNI (Direct Neural Interface).

ArmTech MGL–12: This bullpup-configuration grenade launcher is popular, since it can fire in semi-auto mode and carries substantially more minigrenades than its competitors. Wireless: You can use the wireless link trigger for your grenades, even if you don’t have DNI (Direct Neural Interface).

Aztechnology Striker: The Striker is an extremely light disposable launcher—perfect when you want to deliver a punch and make a quick, unencumbered getaway. Wireless: You can use the wireless link trigger for your missiles, even if you don’t have DNI (Direct Neural Interface).

Krime Cannon: Krime may be a small-time manufacturer, but their assault cannon, simply called the Cannon, is a cheap heavy weapon big on attitude and firepower. It comes standard with modification for trolls, and so is the first weapon in the Sixth World to be intended for larger customers.

Onotari Interceptor: This Saeder-Krupp-developed military missile launcher is designed to fire rockets or guided missiles, of any type. It has two separate barrels and firing chambers, and can load up to two missiles at once, which need not be of the same type. Due to backblast issues, it is not capable of “giving ‘em both barrels.” It features an internal smartgun system.Wireless: You can use the wireless link trigger for your missiles, even if you don’t have DNI (Direct Neural Interface).

Panther XXL: This huge fragging gun is an assault cannon that uses ammunition similar to the primary weapon in many small tanks. It comes with a built-in smartgun system.

Airburst link: This grenade/rocket launcher smartgun accessory uses a “smart” rangefinder to air-burst the explosive projectile at a point deemed to be both a safe distance from the launcher and within the closest possible proximity to the target. An airburst link reduces the scatter distance for a launched grenade by two yards per net hit instead of by one yard per hit (Determine Scatter) when you use the wireless link trigger. Wireless: An airburst link requires wireless functionality to function at all. Both the grenades and the launcher must have wireless mode turned on.

Bipod: This two-legged brace extends downward from the weapon, allowing it to be fired low to the ground with the user in a prone or sitting position. A bipod can be attached to the underbarrel mount of a weapon and provides 2 points of Recoil Compensation when properly deployed. Attaching a bipod takes one minute. Folding up or deploying a bipod is a Simple Action. Removing it is a Complex Action. Wireless: Folding up or deploying the bipod is a Free Action

Concealable holster: This small holster can be worn on the ankle, clipped to the forearm, in the small of the back, or anywhere else it’s unlikely to be seen. The concealable holster adds –1 to the item’s Concealability. Only pistols and tasers fit in a Concealable Holster. Wireless: Wireless sensors and a smart-fabric coated weave allow the holster to alter color and texture in real time adding an additional –1 to the item’s Concealability.

Gas-vent system: Gas-vent recoil compensation systems are barrel-mounted accessories that vent a weapon’s barrel gases at a specific vector to counter muzzle climb. Once installed, a gas-vent cannot be removed. Gas-vent systems provide a number of points of Recoil Compensation equal to their rating.

Gyro mount: This heavy upper-body harness features an attached, articulated, motorized gyro-stabilized arm that mounts an assault rifle or a heavy weapon. The system neutralizes up to 6 points of recoil and movement modifiers. Attaching or removing a weapon from the mount takes a Simple Action. Putting on a gyro-mount harness takes about five minutes, while the quick-release allows you to get out of it with a Complex Action. Wireless: Activating the harness’s quick-release with a wireless signal to exit the harness is a Free Action.

Hidden arm slide: Attached to the forearm and worn under clothing, this slide can accommodate a pistol- sized weapon. It can fit a hold-out, light pistol, or taser. With a hand gesture, the slide releases the weapon/ object right into your hand. If you quick draw the weapon in this slide, the TN for the quick draw is TN 18. It also gives the weapon a –1 Concealability modifier. Wireless: You can ready the weapon in the slide as a Free Action.

Imaging scope: These classic scopes are attached to the top mount; attaching or removing them takes only a Simple Action. Imaging scopes include a micro camera and vision magnification, and they have a Capacity of 3 to hold vision enhancements. Wireless: The scope’s “line of sight” can be shared, allowing you to share what your scope sees with your team (and yourself if you’re using it to look around a corner).

Laser sight: This device uses a laser beam to project a visible dot (in your choice of colors) on the target. This increases the weapon’s Accuracy by 1, which is not cumulative with smartlink modifiers. The laser sight can be attached to either the underbarrel mount or top mount. Activating or deactivating a laser sight is a Simple Action. Wireless: The wireless laser sight provides a +1 modifier on attack tests, not cumulative with smartlink modifiers. Activating and deactivating the laser sight is a Free Action.

Periscope: This adjustable “off-axis” viewer attaches to a top mount and allows an operator to target a weapon around corners, reducing the usual –3 modifier to –2. A periscope can be upgraded with any of the vision enhancements noted on Wireless: The modifier for shooting around corners is reduced to –1.

Quick-draw holster: This easy access holster can hold any weapon of Machine Pistol or smaller size. It reduces the TN for quick-drawing the holstered weapon by 1.

Shock pad: A shock-absorbing pad is situated on the rigid stock of a rifle, shotgun, or heavy weapon, and provides 1 point of recoil compensation

Silencer/suppressor: This barrel-mounted accessory reduces the sound and flash of a weapon’s discharge. It cannot be used with revolvers or shotguns. It applies a –4 modifier on all Perception Tests to notice the weapon’s use or locate the weapon’s firer. Attaching or removing a silencer takes a Complex Action. Wireless: The silencer/suppressor features a Rating 2 microphone with Rating 2 Select Sound Filter and simple software that alerts you via AR if your silencer detects the sound of someone nearby reacting to the sound of the silenced weapon.

Smart firing platform: This is a non-mobile robotic tripod equipped with a remote control pivot that allows for a 180-degree firing arc and a 60-degree inclination. You can mount one smartgun-equipped weapon to the platform, and it will be fired by the device’s onboard Pilot (Device Rating 3). The platform is equipped with a Targeting Autosoft (Rating 3) and can be upgraded with additional autosofts, usually a Clearsight program. You need to set the parameters of who exactly the platform should and shouldn’t shoot at, which are followed by the platform’s pilot. The platform provides 5 points of Recoil Compensation. It has an Initiative attribute of Pilot x 2 and 4D6 Initiative Dice when acting autonomously. Wireless: You can fire the mounted weapon remotely, like a drone with no rigger interface. You can use an implanted smartlink with the smartgun if you’re in VR.

Smartgun system: This connects a firearm or a projectile weapon directly to the user’s smartlink. Incorporating a small camera and laser range finder, the smartlink keeps track of ammunition, heat buildup, and material stress. If you have a smartlink, you can mentally switch between gun modes, eject a clip, and fire the gun without pulling the trigger. The camera lets you shoot around corners without exposing yourself to return fire (at a –3 modifier). The system makes use of advanced calculation software, allowing for precisely calculated trajectories and high precision over any distance.

If you’re using a smartlink, the smartgun system increases the gun’s Accuracy by 2. The smartgun features are accessed either by universal access port cable to an imaging device (like glasses, goggles, or a datajack for someone with cybereyes) or by a wireless connection working in concert with direct neural interface. Retrofitting a firearm with an internal smartgun system doubles the weapon’s price and adds 2 to its Availability. An external smartgun system can be attached to the top mount or underbarrel mount with an `Armorer + Logic (12,4, 1 hour)` Extended Test. The small camera has a capacity of 1 and can be equipped with vision enhancements. Wireless: A wireless smartlink provides a modifier to all attacks with the weapon: +1 if you’re using gear with a smartlink or +2 if you’re using an augmentation for which you paid Essence. Ejecting a clip and changing fire modes are Free Actions

Spare clip: A spare clip comes unloaded but can hold the maximum rounds for the weapon. Each clip is specific to the weapon you buy it for, but they all cost the same. And yes, it’s technically a detachable box magazine, but the Cityspeak word for it is so popular these days that even the catalogs call them clips

Speed loader: The speed loader is a simple device that holds a ring of bullets for fast insertion into a revolver’s cylinder. Each speed loader is specific to the weapon it was designed for. It lets you fully reload a revolver as a Simple Action instead of having to load rounds one at a time as a Complex Action.

Tripod: The tripod provides a stable base to fire a weapon low to the ground with the user kneeling or sitting. A tripod can be attached to the underbarrel mount and provides 6 points of Recoil Compensation when properly deployed. Attaching a tripod takes one minute. Folding up or deploying the bipod is a Free Action. Wireless: Folding up, deploying, or removing the tripod is a Free Action.

### Ammunition

Ammunition is defined by type (regular, gel, APDS, etc.), class of ammo is exchangeable with the other ammo of its type. Meaning all Clips (c) can fit any Clip firearm, all internal magazines (m) fit all internal magazines, every muzzel loader ammo fits any other etc.

| **AMMO, PER 10 SHOTS** | **DAMAGE MODIFIER** | **AP MODIFIER** | **AVAILABILITY** | **COST** |

APDS rounds: These are military-grade armor piercing rounds—their full name is armor piercing discarding sabot. They are designed to travel at high velocities and punch through personal body armor. Assault cannon rounds: These are for assault cannons only, and they’re the only thing assault cannons can load.

Explosive rounds: These slugs carry a shaped-charge explosive, designed to explode and fragment on impact. Explosive rounds misfire whenever you roll a critical glitch. When this happens, you must resist one “attack” with a Damage Value equal to the normal damage done by the weapon (and don’t forget the modifier for the explosive rounds). The attack misses its intended target, and the weapon firing the bullets is destroyed.

Flechette rounds: The payload of a flechette round is made up of tiny, tightly packed metal slivers. The round breaks up and shatters on impact, becoming a tumbling hail of shrapnel. Flechette rounds are devastating against unprotected targets, but not as effective against hardened armor.

Gel rounds: These less-lethal rounds use a hard, jelly-like substance that is a safer alternative to rubber bullets. They are often employed for riot control. Their usually semi-rigid slugs flatten on impact, disbursing their kinetic energy over a larger-than-normal area. Gel rounds inflict Stun damage (AP +1). Gel rounds give the target Disadvantage against being knocked prone (see Resist Knockdown)

Hollow point rounds: Hollow point or dum dum rounds have their tips indented, so they are designed to “mushroom” or expand on impact, becoming a hail of deadly fragments not unlike flechettes, although hollow points are a much older technology. Like flechettes, hollow points work better on unarmored targets and tend to flatten against armor.

Injection darts: For use with dart guns of various types, like the Parashield pistol and rifle. Each injection dart carries a single dose of a drug or toxin (sold separately). The effect of the dart depends on the drug payload, but to successfully deliver that payload, the attack with the dart must get at least one net hit against an unarmored target or three net effect against a target with armor. This is an injection vector toxin attack.

Regular ammo: Also called ball or full metal jacket rounds, these solid slugs are useful for numerous applications (mainly killing things).

Stick-n-Shock: Stick-n-Shock rounds deal electrical Stun damage of equal to the damage of the base weapon –2. They have a flat AP of –5 that replaces the weapon’s AP instead of stacking with it.

Tracer rounds: Tracer ammo burns along the line of flight, making it easier for the shooter to home in on the target. This type of ammunition can only be used in Full Auto weapons and, being loaded as every third round in a clip, is an exception to the restriction of one type of ammunition per clip. They improve the Accuracy of your gun by 1 when you fire more than one round in an Action Phase (cumulative with a laser sight but not a smartgun).

Taser dart: These darts are designed to be loaded into taser weapons

**GRENADES**
---

Grenades are small, self-contained explosive packages. Minigrenades are grenades specifically designed for use with grenade launchers, set to arm when they have traveled 5 yards from their point of origin and explode on impact (unless using an airburst link). This safety feature can be disabled with an `Demolitions + Logic [Mental] (12,4, 5 Minutes) Extended Test`. Minigrenades have the same cost and effects as standard grenades. Use the Throwing Weapons skill when throwing grenades, or Heavy Weapons when launching a grenade from a grenade launcher. Follow the rules for Grenades. Grenades and similar explosives can also be rigged with a tripwire to set up as a basic booby-trap. This requires an `Extended Demolitions + Logic [Mental] (12, 8, 1 Complex Action) Test`. In addition to any other wireless bonus, all grenades have the following wireless feature (use it with caution): Wireless: You can use the wireless link trigger for your grenades, even if you don’t have DNI (Direct Neural Interface).

Flash-bang grenades: Upon detonation, these “concussion” or “stun” grenades explode to create a bright, loud, shocking blast distributed equally over a radius of 10 yards.

Flash-pak: Not a grenade per se, this is an electronic unit the size of a pack of cigarettes containing four quartz-halogen micro-flashes designed to fire in random strobing sequence to blind opponents. Anyone looking in the direction of a flash-pak receives a –4 modifier on attack tests due to the strobing (flare compensation goggles, glasses, etc. reduce this modifier to –2, while flare compensation in cybereyes or as a retinal modification reduces this modifier to –1). The flash-pak has 10 charges; when activated it uses one charge per Combat Turn. When plugged in, it recharges one charge every 10 seconds. Wireless: The strobe sequence can avoid directing strong flashes at the subscribed character; they suffer only half glare penalties from the flash-pak, rounded down. It can recharge by induction, regaining one charge per hour.

Fragmentation grenade: These classic killing devices are designed to spread a cloud of deadly shrapnel over a large area, seriously injuring soft targets.

High-explosive grenade: These grenades are designed to deliver a large blast and concentrated hurt.

Gas Grenade: Instead of exploding, the gas grenade releases a cloud of gas over an area with a radius of 10 yards. This is usually riot control/CS gas, but many other chemical or toxin payloads can be chosen (Toxins, Drugs, and BTLs). The cloud lasts for approximately 4 Combat Turns (less in windy areas, longer in confined areas with poor ventilation, at the gamemaster’s discretion).

Smoke: Similar to the gas grenade, a smoke grenade releases a cloud of smoke over an area with a diameter of 10 yards. The cloud obscures vision, applying visibility modifiers for smoke to relevant tests. The cloud lasts for approximately 4 Combat Turns (less in windy areas, longer in confined areas with poor ventilation, at the gamemaster’s discretion).

Thermal smoke: Identical to a smoke grenade, except that the smoke contains hot particles designed to obscure thermographic vision. Apply the visibility modifiers for thermal smoke. The cloud lasts for approximately 4 Combat Turns (less in windy areas, longer in confined areas with poor ventilation, at the GM’s discretion).

**ROCKETS AND MISSILES**
---

Rockets are projectiles consisting of a light metal or plastic body with stabilizing fins, a propulsion system (usually solid-chemical) and a warhead. Missiles are rockets that carry internal guidance systems, making them more expensive than standard “dumb” rockets.

Rules for firing rockets and missiles are in the Rules chapter Rockets and missiles are set to arm when they have traveled 10 yards from their point of origin and explode on impact. This safety feature can be disabled with an Demolitions + Logic [Mental] (12,4, 5 Minutes) Extended Test. In addition to any other wireless bonus, all rockets and missiles have the following wireless feature: Wireless: You can use the wireless link trigger for your rocket or missile, even if you don’t have DNI (Direct Neural Interface).

Anti-vehicle: AV rockets/missiles contain a shapedcharge warhead designed to burn or punch its way through a vehicle or barrier. Though the impact causes a blast, it is limited compared to that of a High-Explosive projectile. AV attacks have an AP of –10 against vehicles and barriers, –4 against other targets.

Fragmentation: Used principally against people, the warhead discharges high-speed metal or plastic-metal fragments designed to tear into unprotected flesh. These rockets/missiles are very effective against unprotected individuals, but fairly ineffective against barriers, structures, and vehicles.

High explosive: HE rockets/missiles are designed to do heavy damage to a large area. Their blast pattern is similar to that of a grenade, but much larger. They are not particularly effective against hardened targets, such as vehicles or protected military structures. HE weapons use the standard grenade rules for determining the blast and its effects


**EXPLOSIVES**

| **TYPE, PER 2 POUNDS** | **RATING** | **AVAIL** | **COST**      |
| ---------------------- | ---------- | --------- | ------------- |
| Commercial             | 5          | 8R        | 100¥          |

| Detonator cap          | —          | 8R        | 75¥           |

Explosives are primarily used to damage structures. You can use the Demolitions skill to prepare explosives, identify key or weak structural points, and focus the blast. Each Effect on a `Demolitions + Logic [Mental] Test` adds 1 to the explosive’s effective rating. See Barriers, for calculating an explosive’s effect on a barrier.

> Shadowrun really jumped the shark 2e and beyond with square roots and making this insanely complicated. This is Sixfinity not Shadowrun.


All explosives do `Rating * 3 Explosive Damage` they lose 1 rating per Yard (or square) from the origin point.

Commercial explosives: A range of explosive compounds, both solid and liquid, are available to the construction industry for all their destructive needs.

Plastic explosives: These highly stable moldable, and adhesive explosive compounds are military grade. They’re ideal for certain jobs, like breaching walls. They are usually color-tinted to indicate the level of current needed to detonate them, from the black of magnetic- field induction to the chalky white of 440-volt industrial explosives.

Explosive foam: Plastic explosives with the consistency of shaving cream, stored in an aerosol can. Perfect for spraying into crevices, and detonated the same way as regular plastic explosives.

Detonator cap: This detonator is inserted into a mass of explosives and set off either by a programmable timer or radio signal. Setting the timer takes a Complex Action. Wireless: You can set the detonator’s timer with a Simple Action. You can also set it off without a countdown as a Free Action.

### Clothing and Armor





## Chapter 8: Combat

Combat Step By Step

1. Determine Surprise
2. Establish Positions
3. Determine Initiative
4. Take Turns
5. Move to next Round

### Surprise

A band of runners sneaks up on a a group of guards. A hell hound sneaks down an officer hallway, unnoticed by the runners until the hell hound engulfs one of them in flame. In these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other.

The GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the GM compares the Agility  (Sneaking) tests of anyone hiding with the passive Intuition (Perception) [`10 + Intuition`] score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or critter that doesn’t notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.

If you’re surprised, you can’t move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can’t take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren’t.

### Initiative

Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When com⁠bat starts, every participant makes a Initiative Test `3D6 + (Reaction + Intution)` for personal combat, other types of combat have different Initiative Tests on the table below, to determine their place in the initiative order. The GM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time.

The GM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This is the order (called the initiative order) in which they act during each round. The initiative order remains the same from round to round.

If a tie occurs, the DM decides the order among tied DM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters. The GM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character. Optionally, the GM can have the tied characters and monsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first; or have them go simultaneously.

**Initiative Table**

| Initiative Type | Initiative Test      |
| --------------- | -------------------- |
| Personal Combat | Reaction + Intuition |
| Astral Combat   | Inuition x 2         |
| Cybercombat     | Reaction + Intuition |


#### Timed Items & Initiative

Unless the item allows a timer to be set, in which case the player can determine when, these items go off at the end of the players turn.

### Your Turn
On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed and take either one major action or two minor actions. You decide whether to move first or take your action first. Your speed—sometimes called your walking speed—is noted on your character sheet.

The most com⁠mon actions you can take are described in the "Actions in Combat". Many features and other abilitie⁠s provide additional options for your action.

The “Movement and Position” section gives the rules for your move.

You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can’t decide what to do on your t⁠urn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as described in “Actions in Combat”

### Movement and Position

In combat, characters and NOC's are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand.

On your turn if you use a Dash you can use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following the rules here.

Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can constitute your entire move. However you're moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.

#### Breaking Up Your Move

You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your another action. For example, if you have a speed of 10 yards, you can move 2 yards, take your action, and then move 8 yards.

#### Difficult Terrain

Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains.

Furniture-strewn offices, rubble filled streets, treacherous staircases—the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.

Every yard of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra yard. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.

Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.

#### Being Prone

Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are prone, a condition described in the appendix.

You can drop prone without using any of your speed. Standing up takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to one third your speed. For example, if your speed is 10 yards, you must spend 3 yards of movement to stand up. You can't stand up if you don't have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.

To move while prone, you must crawl or use magic. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra yard. Crawling 1 yard in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 yards of movement.

#### Moving around Other Creatures

You can move through a nonhostile creature's space. In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature's space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature's space is difficult terrain for you.

Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can't willingly end your move in its space.

If you leave a hostile creature's reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained later in the chapter.

### Creature Size

Each creature takes up a different amount of space.

The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. Objects sometimes use the same size categories.

| Size       | Space    |
| ---------- | -------- |
| Small      | 1y by 1y |
| Medium     | 1y by 1y |
| Large      | 2y by 2y |
| Huge       | 3y by 3y |
| Gargantuan | 4y by 4y |

#### Space

A creature's space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn't 1 yard wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a Medium Orc stands in a 5-foot-wide doorway, other creatures can't get through unless the Orc lets them.

A creature's space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there's a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 1-yard radius around another one.

Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature.

If four Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there's little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.

### Action In Combat

The Action economy of Sixfinity is mare structured than the economy in Shadowrun. 

Every **combat turn** a character gets:
- 1 Complex Action OR 2 Simple Actions
- 1 Bonus Action (if the character has something that allows it)
- 1 Reaction




#### Free Actions


#### Simple Actions
A Simple Action is one step more complicated than a Free Action and requires a bit more concentration to attempt. Only a few Simple Actions, however, require a Success Test to accomplish. Simple Actions can only be taken on a character’s turn.

- Dash
- Change Gun Mode
- Fire Weapon/Throw Weapon
- Insert Clip
- Pick Up/Put Down Object
- Quick Draw
- Ready Weapon

##### DASH

You move up to your speed. See Movement and Position

##### CHANGE GUN MODE

A character holding a ready firearm can change its firing mode via a Simple Action. If the weapon is a properly linked smartgun, it takes only a Free Action to change the mode. See Firearms, and Smartgun Systems. This includes changing a shotgun’s choke if the gun does not have a smartgun link. See Shotguns.

##### FIRE WEAPON

A character may fire a ready firearm/or throw a ready thrown weapon, in single-shot, semi-automatic, or burst-fire mode via a Simple Action (See Firearms). If a character has one weapon in each hand, he may   fire once with each weapon by expending one Simple Action (see Attacker Using a Second Firearm). Note that single-shot weapons may be fired only once per turn. Likewise, only one long burst may be fired in each turn.

##### Insert Clip

A character may insert a fresh clip into a ready firearm by taking a Simple Action, they quickly eject the first clip before inserting a new one as one simple action.

##### Pick Up/Put Down Object

A character may pick up an object within reach or put down one that he was holding by expending a Simple Action (note that just dropping an object is a Free Action).

##### Quick Draw

A character may attempt to quick-draw a pistol or pistol-sized weapon and immediately fire it by expending a Quick Draw action. For the character to successfully draw the weapon, the player must make a `Pistols + Reaction (18)` Test. If the pistol is held in a quick-draw holster, reduce the TN to 12. If the test is successful, the character draws the pistol and fires as a single Quick Draw Simple Action. If the test fails, he clears the gun but cannot fire with the same Simple Action. If he glitches, the gun is stuck in the holster or dropped. On a critical glitch, it is flung across the room or misfired while still in the holster.

Only weapons that can be fired with a Simple Action can be quick-drawn. Two weapons may be quick-drawn and fired simultaneously, but this raises the TN on the `Pistols + Reaction` Test to 24 (see Attacker Using a Second Firearm). A separate `Pistols + Reaction (24)` Test is required for each pistol (TN 18 if they are held in quick-draw holsters).

##### Ready Weapon 

A character may ready a weapon by spending a Simple Action. This usually comes up during surpruse. The weapon may be a firearm, melee weapon, throwing weapon, ranged weapon, or mounted or vehicular weapon. Readying entails drawing a firearm from a holster, drawing a throwing or melee weapon from a sheath, picking up any kind of weapon, nocking an arrow in a bow, or generally preparing any kind of weapon for use. A weapon must be ready before it can be used.

A character can ready a number of small throwing weapons, such as throwing knives or shuriken, equal to one-half his Agility (round down) per Ready Weapon action.

#### Bonus Actions

Various edges, augmentations, spells, and other abili⁠ties let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action. You can take a bonu⁠s action only when a sp⁠ecial ability, spell, or other feature of the game states that you can do something as a bon⁠us action. You otherwise don’t have a bo⁠nus action to take. A bonus action is for all intents and purposes an additional Simple Action.

For example the Augmentation Wired Reflexes allows a Bonus Action per round per Rating of the Wired Reflexes.

You choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the bonus action’s timing is specified, and anything that deprives you of your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a bon⁠us action.

#### Reactions

Certain spe⁠cial abili⁠ties, spells, and situations allow you to take a spe⁠cial action called a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else’s. The opportunity attack, described in " Making an Attack ", is the most com⁠mon type of reaction.

When you take a reaction, you can’t take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature’s turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the reaction.

#### Complex Actions

A Complex Action requires concentration and/or finesse. Only one Complex Action is possible per Turn. A character who wishes to take a Complex Action may also take a Free Action thatturn, but no Simple Actions are possible.

- Disengage
- Dodge/Full Defense
- Fire Automatic Weapon/Mounted Vehicle Weapon
- Melee/Unarmed Attack
- Reload Weapon
- Use Skill
- Use Object
- Ready

##### Disengage

If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.

##### Dodge/Full Defense

When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated (as explained in the appendix) or if your speed drops to 0.

##### Fire Automatic Weapon

A character may fire a ready firearm in full auto fire mode or a Mounted Vehicle Weapon by taking a Complex Action.

##### Melee/Unarmed Attack

A character may make a melee or unarmed attack by taking a Complex
Action. A character may also attack multiple
targets within melee range with a single Complex Action

##### Reload Weapon

##### Use Skill

##### Use Object

##### Ready

Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn.

First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include "If the Samurai steps on the trapdoor, I'll pull the lever that opens it," and "If the Troll steps next to me, I move away."

When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.


### Cover Mechanics

You usually don’t have to take any action to avoid attacks. It’s a reflex, and covered by your Defense score. You might take actions to modify your Defense, however, such as Dodge.

Taking cover is a special case. In modern games, the prevalence of firearms makes it prudent to put something between yourself and their firing arcs. You can move behind cover.

Cover provides a bonus to your Defense against all ranged attacks.


| Rating | Defense Bonus              | Ranged Attack Penalty     |
| ------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 1      | 1                          | –1                        |
| 2      | 2                          | –2                        |
| 3      | 4                          | –3                        |
| 4      | 6                          | -4                        |
| Total  | Can’t be attacked at range | Can’t make ranged attacks |

### Attacks

An attack is rolled as 3D6 + Agility (Ranged or Unarmed) / Strength (Armed) + Relevent Skill Rating

For example if making a ranged attack with Agility 3 and Automatics 4 they would add 7 to their roll. 

The attacker needs to exceed the Defense of the target to hit.

#### Accuracy

All weapons have an Accuracy score that acts as a Limit for that weapon. Accuracy scores reflect the quality and craftsmanship of a weapon and determine the number of Effect that can be applied in a skill test.

Melee weapons, those that were made for combat, have an average Accuracy of 5. Improvised weapons— items that can be used, however awkwardly, to inflict damage but are not designed for combat, such as a golf club or frying pan—usually have an accuracy of 4. Random objects used as weapons that are very unwieldy or heavy (like a chair, barstool, or refrigerator) generally have an Accuracy of 3. Standard Weapons that are in poor condition or broken can have their Accuracy reduced by 1.

Unarmed attacks use the Inherent Limit [Physical] as determined by the Attributes of the character and do not have an Accuracy rating. Items used as part of the Unarmed Attack, also use the Physical limit.

Most basic ranged weapons have an accuracy of 4 or 5. Specialized ranged weapons, like some sniper rifles, have an accuracy of 6 or higher. Improvised ranged weapons have an Accuracy of 3, and broken, old, damaged, or otherwise flawed ranged weapons can have their Accuracy reduced by 1, to a minimum of 1.

### Damage

Involved as they are in an illegal and often hazardous line of work, runners get hurt and get hurt often. What kind of damage, how bad an injury is, and how much it affects the character vary greatly depending on the situation.

#### Types of Injury

Damage in Sixfinity is defined as Physical or Stun. Each type of damage is tracked on a separate Condition Monitor.

##### Physical Damage

Physical damage, the most dangerous type, is the kind done by guns, explosions, most melee weapons, and many magic spells. Weapons that inflict Physical damage have the letter “P” following their Damage Value. Physical damage takes a longer time to heal.


##### Stun Damage

Stun damage—bruising, muscle fatigue, and the like— is the kind done by fists, kicks, blunt weapons, stun rounds, shock weapons, concussion grenades, and some magic spells. If something does Stun damage, the letter “S” follows the Damage Value. Stun damage takes a shorter time to heal.


### Resistance

If a creature or character has an effect which gives them resistance to a type of damage (see damage types) they take half damage from that source.

### Vulnerability

If a creature or character has an effect which gives them vulnerability to a type of damage (see damage types) they take double damage from that source. 

### Healing

- First Aid: Another character can aid you with a First Aid action, as described under Complex Actions in this chapter. You can’t benefit from another First Aid action until you take more damage (there is only so much benefit you can gain from basic care).
- You can take a breather after a combat encounter. This is a 5-minute rest that lets you catch your breath, tend to minor cuts and abrasions, drink some water, and so on. After a breather, you get back 5 + Body in Physical Health. You can take only one breather after an encounter. If you were at 0 Physical Health when the combat encounter ended, you cannot take a breather at all.
- You can get some sleep. If you can get at least 6 hours of restful sleep, you can recover Physical Health Rating x 10 + Body in Physical Health.
- You receive extended medical attention. Another character can tend to your injuries with a {TN} 13 Logic (Medicine) test that lasts 1 hour or is concurrent with sleep as above. The character in charge of your care must use proper medical tools and supplies (found easily in any clinic, hospital, or doctor’s office). Success means you recover an additional amount of Physical Health equal to 5 + treating character’s Logic + treating chaacters Medicine Rating.

Breather = 5 min rest, regain 5 + BOD Physical Health. One per scene. Not if you hit 0.

### Damage Types

Damage comes from three main sources: impact, ballistic, and penetrating attacks. There are six elemental/other damage types they are all considered Penetrating damage.

Impact damage is inflicted by weapons and attacks that rely on sheer force, such as unarmed strikes and most hand-to-hand weapons. Most armor protects against impact damage, providing whatever Armor Rating is listed.

Ballistic damage usually comes from firearms or shrapnel, and cuts through armor not specifically designed to stop it. In most cases, only modern bullet-resistant armor protects against it, with an Armor Rating.

Penetrating damage ignores most armor and comes from special weapons, hazards, and abilities. Very few things reduce penetrating damage.

#### Stun Damage
If a character recieves enough stun damage to reach zero hitpoints they suffer the Stunned Condition.

#### Impact Damage Types:
- Bludgeoning
- Piercing
- Slashing

#### Ballistic Damage Types
Usually from bullets

#### Penetrating Damage Types
- Acid (any type of corrosive effect)
- Cold (frostbite and other effects of extreme cold)
- Electrical (electric shocks and burns)
- Explosive (intense shock waves in air or water)
- Fire (heat and open flame)
- Poison (both natural and synthetic toxins)
- Psychic (damage to the mind)

## Chapter 9: Magic

The world is made up of two parts.

The Sleeping World & The Awakened World.

The Sleeping World is unaware of magic. This Chapter focuses on the Awakened World.

The Awakened world is permeated by mana, the energy of magic. Mana is invisible and intangible. It cannot be detected, measured, or influenced by machines, only by living beings. Mana is sensitive. to emotion and responds to the will of the Awakened. It allows magicians to cast spells. Mana also makes the powers of adepts and various Awakened creatures possible.

**Magic Attribute**

Awakened creatures and magical effects have their magical potency measured by either the Magic or Force attributes. Magic is the attribute possessed by Awakened creatures—including humanoids while Force is the principle attribute for magic items and entities of pure mana—spirits and spells.

Magic is a Special attribute that measures the character’s magical power. Like other attributes, Magic has a starting value of 1. The Magic attribute may be increased in the same way as other attributes, to a maximum of 6. Magical study and insight can raise a magician’s Magic attribute beyond the normal maximum though a process called initiation.

If a character’s Magic is ever reduced to 0, she can no longer perform any kind of magic. The magician has “burned out,” losing all magical ability and becoming a mundane forever. She retains all magical skills and knowledge, but lacks the ability to use them. Active skills become Knowledge skills. 

Spells, spirits, and magic items have an attribute known as Force. This measures the magical power of the object, spell, or being. Force is measured on the same scale as humanoid attributes (natural 1 to 6). For spells and items, this is often their only attribute.

**The Three Realms**

Magicians are aware of three “realms” of existence. The first is the physical realm, our natural physical world, and all of its corresponding physical laws. 

On one “side” of us, we have the astral realm. The astral realm occupies the same “space” as the physical plane, but has different “physical” (“astral?”) laws. It is always there, right next door, just a step sideways. It thrives on life, and so emotion, thought, and spirit are emphasized on the astral. Without life, there is no astral space; and so without a thriving gaiasphere to support it, the astral plane does not extend into space. Using what is often called their "third eye" Magicians can see the Astral realm.

On the other side (and curving around, as it were, to meet the astral plane on its far edge) we have the metaplanar realm. The metaplanes are not one place but many, and their true nature and purpose are beyond the ken of ordinary magicians. (See The Planes)

Each realm is separated by a barrier, a wall of sorts that stops us from randomly wandering from one realm into another. Magicians have learned to extend their senses onto the astral realm, to astrally perceive what goes on there. Full magicians can actually leave their physical bodies and project their spirits onto the astral plane. Psychic travel to the metaplanes is also possible, but is a much more complicated affair.

**Magical Lodges**

In order to progress in her studies, a magician must have a collection of symbols, writings,
tools, and other material that allows her to record her progress, gives her room to expand her
knowledge, and assists her in her magical endeavors. Such a collection of items and information is known as a magical lodge. Magicians of the same tradition can share a magical lodge.

A magical lodge is required to improve Magic-linked skills, learn new spells, and perform Ritual Spellcasting. A lodge has a Force rating that is used to measure its power. The Force of a lodge must be at least equal to the skill rating being learned or the force of a spell being cast.

A lodge has a Resource cost of 2 per Force point, and the lodge’s rating can be improved later.

For example if you want to purchase a Force 1 Lodge you need to make a {TN} 12 Resource test. A Force 3 Lodge would be a {TN} 16. 

The money is spent to buy the supplies used to build the lodge. Once the supplies are gathered, the magician must complete an activation ritual that will “awaken” the lodge and construct its astral presence. The actual process requires 1 day per point of Force desired. An activated lodge acts as an astral barrier. Any magicians involved in the activation of the lodge are unaffected by this barrier, and can allow other astral forms to pass through it at will. A lodge contains the astral signatures of the magicians who activated it (see Astral Signatures), and is magically linked to them. This link can be tracked using astral projection (see Astral Tracking).

To increase the rating of an existing lodge, additional materials must be acquired. An activation ritual must also be performed, taking a number of days equal to the difference between the current Force and the desired Force. The cost of searching and gathering can be simplified to a cost of Resource 2 per Force point as above. Improving a Force 4 lodge to Force 6, for example, would cost Resource {TN} 22 (6 * 2 + 10) and take two days of ritual.

### Spellcasting

When a magician casts a spell, the player first chooses the Force of the spell and then rolls her `3D6 + Spellcasting + Magic VS {TN}`. Other sources of power (foci, spirit spellcasting aid) and Visibility modifiers may affect the final outcome. The success of a spell is measured by the {TN} on the test.

Many times the {TN} is the targets Defense for targeted spells. 

Steps for Spellcasting:

- Step 1: Choose a Spell. She can cast any spell she knows. Remember you can only have one Concentration Spell active at a time.
- Step 2: Choose the Force. The maximum Force a spell can be cast at equals the spellcaster’s Magic rating x 2. 
- Step 3: Choose the targets. Area spells you choose a location for the center, targeted spells you choose a target withing Line of Sight.
- Step 4: Make the Spellcasting Test. `3D6 + Spellcasting + Magic` VS {TN}. (Unless opposed the {TN} is 10 + Force)
- Step 5: Determine the effect. Some spells only require a success and the Effect determines how effective the spell is. Opposed test against living targets often trigger Willpower or other Reactions. Spells cast on astral objects like mana barriers or active foci are resisted with Force. **The Effect CANNOT exceed the Spells Force**
- Step 6: Fatigue Test. `3D6 + Willpower VS. 9 + Spells Force` if you succeed you cast it with minimal issues, if you fail you suffer effects (see Spell Fatigue below)
- Step 7: Concentration. Many spells can be sustained for as long as the magician is willing to concentrate on the spell, as noted in the spell’s Duration. If you take damage while maintaining concentration you must succeed on a `3D6 + Willpower Vs 10 or Half Damage taken rounded down up to 25 whichever is higher`

### Counterspelling

**This is considered a Reaction.**

Counterspelling is used to interrupt other spells, either as they are being cast or while they are sustained. To interrupt a spell as it is being cast a Counterspelling roll `3D6 + Counterspelling + Magic` is rolled versus the opposing Spellcasting roll `3D6 + Spellcasting + Magic`, if the Counterspell is higher the spell is canceled. Force does not come into play here because the Spell has not been completed yet.

For example Paige is fighting another Mage in a bar. The other Mage is preparing to cast Fireball. Paige rolls `3D6 + Counterspelling + Magic` she has a Counterspelling of 4 and a Magic of 5, the rolls a 12 and ends up with a 21. The enemy Mage has a Magic of 4 and a Spellcasting of 4, rolls a 12 on 3D6. Since Paige beat the enemy Mage's roll the spell is Countered and no Fireball is cast. 

When dispelling it is very similar, a Counterspelling + Magic Opposed Test is made against the target spell’s Force + caster’s Magic, if the roll is greater than the {TN} of the spell it is dispelled.

For Example if Paige is trying to dispel a sealed door. She rolls `3D6 + Counterspelling + Magic vs {TN} from the Gamemaster`. The GM knows that the caster had a Force of 6 for the spell and their magic was 6 so `{TN} = 10 + 6 + 6` the {TN} is 22.


### Force

A spell’s only attribute is its Force—the measure of the spell’s raw power. A spell’s Force helps determine its effectiveness and its Fatigue. Thee Force of a spell is chosen by the caster during spellcasting, typically at a value up to the Magic attribute of the magician who cast it. The maximum Force that a spell can be cast at is equal to twice the character’s Magic.

For simplicity, you may wish to decide that spells are always cast at a Force equal to the character’s Magic attribute unless otherwise noted. This certainly makes tracking Fatigue rolls easier.

A spell’s Force limits the Effect that can be achieved on the Spellcasting Test. So if you cast a Force 3 spell and get 5 Effect, only 3 of those count. In other words, Force has a limiting effect on spells—the more oomph you put into the spell, the better you can succeed with it. 

### Spell Fatigue 

When using a power, the player rolls a fatigue test for the character. This is a test with a target number of `{TN} = 9 + Spells Force / 2 rounded down`. Often times spells have a Fatigue Value or FV listed this represents the `Spell Force / 2 Rounded down` math already done.

Fatigue tests are Willpower Reactions. `3D6 + Willpower VS. 9 + Fatigue Value`

If the test succeeds, using the power costs the character only negligible effort. If the fatigue test fails, the character takes the Fatigue Value in Stun Damage (see Stun Damage) if they suffer enough Stun damage to reduce them to zero Physical Health they are Stunned for 1 Minute. After that they are 1 point away from Stunned and Exhausted.

- Exhausted: The character is nearly spent. An exhausted character has a –3 penalty to all tests, moves at half their normal speed, and cannot Run or Charge. 

Additionally, if the character loses more than half their Physical Health while exhausted, they become unconscious for 1d6 hours, or until restored to greater than half their maximum Physical Health. After 6 hours unconscious, they regain 10 + Body in Physical Health and regain consciousness.


Characters can recover from fatigue by resting, as follows:
- Taking a 5-minute breather is enough to recover BOD + STR in Stun Damage. You gain this benefit in addition to the normal amount of Physical Health you recover from a breather.
- Resting for at least 4 hours, with only light activity (talking, reading, and the like, but not standing or riding) allows you to recover from all Stun Damage, so long as you also eat and drink something during that time.
- Sleeping for at least 6 hours allows you to recover from being exhausted, as well as all Stun Damage in addition to the Physical Health benefits of such rest.

**Optional Rule**

Simple Fatigue.

Gamemasters and players should keep the following system in mind for making spell Fatigue calculation easier. Rather than choosing the Force and calculating the Fatigue each time a spell is cast, simply assume that spells are always cast at a Force equal to the character’s Magic attribute. In this case, the Fatigue for each spell can be pre-calculated and written on the character sheet, so you do not have to bother calculating it during actual gameplay.

If a character decides at some point to cast a spell at a different Force value, simply modify the Fatigue by +1 or –1 for every 2 points the player increases or decreases the Force, respectively.

For example, a player who has a mage with Magic 5 can assume that she always casts her Acid Stream spell at Force 5, and so she writes the Fatigue down as FV 5 (based on Acid Stream’s Fatigue formula for Force 5). If she decides to cast the spell at Force 3 instead, the Fatigue is modified to FV 4 (base FV 5 minus 1 per 2 points of Force reduction). If she decides to cast it at Force 7, her FV would be 6 (+1 per 2 points)—and the Fatigue if failed would be Physical Damage in lieu of Fatigue (see overcasting below) as the Force exceeds her Magic.

### Overcasting

If a caster wants the Spells Force to exceed their Magic Rating (maximum force is Magic x 2) they will suffer more dangerous outcomes than simple fatigue. If they fail the Fatituge test they will take the Fatigue Value as Damage instead of suffering Exhaustion levels as above. 

For example is Paige has a Magic of 5 and decides to cast Acid Stream at Force 7 the Fatigue Value (based on the spells formula) would be 6. Since The Force 7 exceeds Paige's Magic if she fails her Fatigue check (`3D6 + Willpower VS. {TN} 15`) Paige will take 6 points of Physical damage instead of suffering exhaustion. 

While dangerous it represents a magician putting their life into a spell. In some settings, some spells **require** it to be physical.

### Learning New Spells

Before a magician can cast a spell, she must learn it. A magician can learn a spell from either a spell formula or from another magician, but the source has to be of a compatible tradition (gamemaster’s discretion). A magician must have a magical lodge in order to experiment with and master what she has learned, adapting it to her own personal style and understanding of the magical world.

For most magicians (especially mages), the archaic master-apprentice model of learning a spell has largely passed by the wayside. Given the proliferation of magical information on the Net, learning from formulae has become the default method of learning new spells. Finding a spell formula is as easy as checking the Net. 

Certain spells (especially combat spells and mental manipulations) are illegal or controlled in some jurisdictions, so characters must engage caution when pursuing them, or look to black market providers/teachers. In addition, a character must expend 5 permanent Experience points per spell learned. The costs are the same whether the instruction is in person or through the Net.

Once a magician has access to a spell formula or teacher, she makes a Spellcasting + Logic (15,5, 1 day) Extended Test (see Extended Tests). Instructors can provide Help and grnt advantage on the tests. All injury modifiers apply, as do distractions for sustaining spells, poor conditions, and so on.

A character engaged in learning a spell must work on it for consecutive days. Learning a spell does not require all of the character’s
attention during those days, but the magician must be able to devote 8 hours each day solely to learning the spell until she has it mastered.
Should a day be missed before the test is completed, the character automatically fails the test and does not learn the spell. No Experience is expended in this case, but any money and time spent on instruction is lost. 

### Traditions

#### Hermetic Tradition

Concept: The scientific study of magic as a complex pattern of elemental forces that can be controlled with the right formulae and rituals.

- Combat: Fire Magic
- Detection: Air Magic
- Physical Health: Man
- Illusion: Water Magic
- Maniuplation: Earth Magic

A hermetic magician’s ability to perform magic comes from the study of a complex set of theories that describe mana, the dimensions of astral space, and how they interact with the physical world. The science of thaumaturgy, as this discipline is called, draws those who rely on logic and reason as their means of evaluating the world. As with any vibrant field, while the basics are largely agreed upon, the theories as to how it all works and what magic can do are as varied as the mages themselves. By seeking understanding, mages can perform magic through ritual and focused power of will.

Mages are scholars who study and practice magic using tried and established formulas and procedures. Mages continually research the theories and laws of magic, seeking a deeper understanding of the structure of the universe. As their knowledge increases, so does their power.

In Veilstriders Hermetic Mages attend school at Arkham in Mass. 

Examples: Harry Dresden

#### Sorcerous Tradition

Concept: The channeling of internal magical power through an object to manifest power

- Combat: Air Magic
- Detection: Earth Magic
- Physical Health: Water Magic
- Illusion: Man
- Maniuplation: Fire Magic

This tradition is taught to people who are born with magical latent ability. Taught to channel it through an object like a wand.

Examples: Harry Potter

#### Shamanic Tradition

- Combat: Beasts
- Detection: Water
- Physical Health: Earth
- Illusion: Air
- Manipulation: Man

To a shaman, the world is filled with living spirits, powers the shaman calls on for magical aid. Shamanic magicians summon spirits that are tied to nature: air, earth, water, beasts, and man. To a shaman, these are the spirits of the natural world. They are spirits of skies and storms, of mountains and valleys, of lakes and rivers, of birds and rats, and of the mass of humanity, for even man is a part of nature. Communion and trafficking with such spirits is a venerable and honored tradition among shamans.

Examples: Native American Magic.

### The Astral World

While the physical realm is the world characters know and walk in every day, another realm exists alongside it, invisible and unnoticed by most of the people on the planet. that place is called the astral plane, a sort of photo-negative of the physical world where only living things—things infused with mana—are real.

Mana, the essence of magic, flows from the metaplanes into our physical world and through it to the astral plane, where it pools and infuses the astral plane with its nature.

The astral plane is fueled by the life force that exists in and on our planet, and the general aura of that force illuminates the astral world at all times with an ambient glow. Things that exist only on the physical plane can be seen and heard from the astral, albeit with blurred features and indistinct sound—emotional content registers far more strongly than exact details. 

#### Astral Willpower

Many Awakened characters can perceive the astral plane from the physical world. This ability is called astral perception sometimes called "Third Eye". It is the primary sense used in the astral plane; it shows auras, allowing magicians to examine living creatures in the physical world as well as creatures who live on the astral plane. Astral Willpower is available to characters who take the Magician quality during character generation.

It takes a Simple Action to shift one’s perception from the astral to the physical, and another to shift it back again (it is not possible to see both at the same time, though almost everything in physical space is reflected on the astral, albeit without detail). A character using astral perception is considered dual-natured, active on both the physical and astral planes simultaneously.

While astral perception allows an Awakened character to sense the astral plane, actually interpreting what is sensed takes practice. Interpreting auras to gain information about the person or thing to whom they belong is called Assensing. A magician who wishes to learn more about an aura must make an Assensing test `Magic + Perception Rating` test against the {TN} as outlined on the Assensing Table (below). Without attempting to read an aura, a magician can still get an impression of what type of aura it is (spell, spirit, living creature, etc.).

Like physical perception, a character using astral perception should not need to make a test to see things that are immediately obvious (and since astral forms are bright and vibrant, this means that most astral forms are easily noticed). An actual test should only be called for when an astral being is specifically trying to hide, or when a character is trying to astrally observe in detail; in both these situations, an Assensing Test is made.

By assensing something’s aura, a magician can gain information. The auras of living beings show their general health, emotions, and magical nature (if any). Enchanted objects show their magical nature. Non-magical and non-living objects have only gray, lackluster shadows rather than auras, but pick up impressions from being in contact with living auras. Assensing can read any impressions left behind on an object.

Spells cast upon an individual show up as a separate aura surrounding that person for the duration of the spell. Once a spell has been rendered permanent, the aura is no longer present. It is occasionally possible to see the traces that magic spells leave behind in a target’s aura; see Astral Signatures for more information.

Whenever you have to perform a physical, non-magical task (shooting a gun, driving a car, and so forth) while astrally perceiving, you suffer Disadvantage on the roll. While astrally perceiving, a magician can cast mana spells at astral opponents. Other astral forms can engage an astrally perceiving magician in astral combat or cast mana spells at him as well.

Astral perception is a psychic sense that is not linked to the character’s physical sight. A blind magician can still magically perceive the astral plane and the creatures and auras within. Likewise, deaf magicians can “hear” in astral space.

| 30   | An accurate diagnosis of any disease or toxins which afflict the subject. Who their first born child is, what they had for breakfast              |


#### Astral Signatures

Magical skills and abilities produce an astral signature on anything affected by them, which is detectable using assensing. An astral signature is the magical “fingerprint” of the Awakened creature who created it. A signature lasts for a number of hours equal to a magical effects Force after the effect ends. Foci and other magical items (like magical lodges) always contain the astral signature of their owner (or owners). A character can attempt to read an astral signature with an Assensing Test. A {TN} 20+ is required to detect the signature. Once seen, a signature can be recognized if the character sees it again (perhaps requiring a memory test). With a {TN} 25, she also gets an impression of what magical effect created the signature (the magical skill used and the general class of spell or spirit).

Magical forensic investigators use astral signatures to gather information about criminal magicians, so characters should be careful about leaving astral signatures where they are likely to be seen by anyone who knows them.

A magician using astral perception may take a number of Complex Actions equal to the Force of an astral signature to erase it completely.

As Awakened characters grow in power, they often find that their initial explorations into magic and the astral plane can only take them so far in understanding and increasing their abilities. In order to increase their powers, magicians will often choose to undergo initiation in the mysteries of magic, the astral world, and the metaplanes in hope of increasing their connection with the Awakened world.

Initiation is measured in grades, beginning with Grade 1 and increasing. At the end of a character’s first initiation, she is a Grade 1 initiate. When she completes her second initiation, she is a Grade 2 initiate, and so on. The numerical system is for tracking initiation levels in game terms: each tradition refers to grades of initiation in their own way. 

The cost to initiate is equal to 10 + (Grade x 3) in Experience points. Characters who wish to initiate must pay that cost in order to achieve their new grade.
 
A character’s initiate grade cannot exceed her Magic attribute. If a character’s Magic is reduced below her initiate grade, she loses that level of initiation and the metamagic she gained with it.

#### Initiate Powers

**Increased Magic**

An initiate’s natural maximum for the Magic attribute is 6 + her grade of initiation. She will still have to pay normally to increase her Magic attribute. 

**Metaplanar Access**

Upon a character’s first initiation, a character usually gains access to a special Demiplane for their Initiation. 

**More Powers**

Some settings have more powers for Initiation.

### Spells

How to read a spell.

- Category: This describes the manner in which a spell affect its target, as well as what spirits will be associated with that type of spell. The categories are: Combat, Detection, Physical Health, Illusion, and Manipulation.
- Type: Spell Type is either mana (M) or physical (P). Mana spells affect their targets through the mana that permeates the astral and physical planes affecting the target in a magical and spiritual manner that is only effectively resisted by the Willpower of a living or magical being. Physical spells directly target the body; resistance relies on the target’s Stamina. Only mana spells can affect astral forms. Either type of spell may be used in the physical world, but mana spells cannot affect non-living targets.
- Range: All spells have a range at which they can be cast. For most spells, the range is line of sight (LOS). If the caster can see the target, regardless of distance, it can be affected. Some spells, particularly health spells, require the caster to touch the intended target in order for the spell to work. Other spells affect all valid targets within an area, defined as a circle with a radius equal to the spell’s Force in yards.
- Test & {TN}: The type of test required if opposed, or the {TN} required (usually 10 + Force)
- Duration: Duration is either Instant, Concentration, or Permanent. Instant spells end the moment they are cast, and their full effects are felt immediately. Concentration spells last for as long as the magician concentrates on them. Permanent spells must be Concentrationated for a short time, after which their effects become “natural” and no longer require magic or concentration to maintain. The time required to make a spell’s effects permanent is equal to twice the Fatgiue Value in Combat Turns.
- Fatigue Value: This describes the Fatigue Value required for the Fatigue Test. Fatigue is based on the spell’s Force; the more powerful the spell, the more exhausting it is to cast. Fatigue is variable, based on the spell’s Force ÷ 2, rounded down, and modified by Fatigue modifiers appropriate to each spell. Failed Fatigue Tests cause Stun Damage and possibly Exhaustion (see Spell Fatigue above), unless the spell is overcast (cast at a Force higher than the magician’s Magic see above), in which case it causes Fatigue Value in Physical damage. Note that no Fatigue Value can ever be less than 1.


### Combat Spells

Combat spells use mana to create damaging effects, either by direct or indirect means. Think of Direct spells as Saving Throw Spells and Indirect Spells as To Hit Spells. Though Indirect Area spells require a Quickness Reaction.

Direct Combat spells channel damaging power directly into the target’s inner being, affecting them from within, and so bypass armor (but not Toughness). 

Indirect Combat spells create an external damaging medium (often elemental in nature) that is used to attack the target. 

**Direct Combat Spells**: Handle these as an Opposed Test. The caster’s `Spellcasting + Magic` is resisted by the target’s Stamina (for physical spells) or Willpower (for mana spells), plus Counterspelling (if available). 

The caster needs beat the opposed roll by at least 1 to take effect. Direct Combat spells affect the target from the inside, so armor does not help with resistance. Toughness does help with the damage though.

> For example Paige casts Manabolt at a Security Guard. She has a 5 Spellcasting and 5 Magic. She rolls `3D6 + 5 + 5` she rolls 17 the Security Guard has a Stamina of 3 and no Counterspell so he rolls `3D6 +3` to resist the spell.

Direct Combat spells cast against nonliving objects are treated as Success Tests; the caster must achieve Effect to beat the item’s Object Resistance. Effect increase damage as normal (the object does not get a resistance test).

Direct Combat spells involve channeling mana directly into a target as destructive and damaging energies rather than generating a damaging effect. Affecting the target on this fundamental level with raw mana requires more focus and more power than producing other spell effects. After the Spellcasting is resisted the caster choses whether or not to apply any Effect to increase the damage value of the spell as normal.

**Indirect Combat Spells**: Indirect Combat spells are treated like ranged combat attacks; the caster makes a `Spellcasting + Magic` Success Test versus the target’s Defense. 

Indirect Combat spells (also commonly called AOE spells) generate a spell construct at the point of origin (the caster) which travels down the mystic link to the chosen target, whereupon it discharges and the effect defined in the spell description manifests. The spell traverses the distance between the caster and the target near instantly, but travels over the physical or astral plane to do so only to take effect when it “hits”. Hence, Indirect Spells are handled as ranged attacks and require a physically solid target or astrally active target to hit. As they travel down the link to the chosen target such effects may be impeded by physical obstacles or mana barriers. They may impact transparent obstacles (such as glass) and do not “bounce” off reflective surfaces used for line of sight. Instead the spell takes effect at the point of contact with an obstructing barrier. In the case of mana barriers, use the standard rules for casting through barriers, but if the spell’s Force is insufficient to beat the mana barrier it “fizzles” at the point of contact with the barrier.

If the spell reaches the chosen target and it fails to dodge with Quickness (+ Counterspelling, if available) ({TN} 10 + Spells Force), the target then resists damage with Toughness + armor. Each point reduces the Damage Value. The target takes the damage left over, if any after the Toughness and Armor Protection is deducted. Note that nonliving objects resist damage from an Indirect Combat spell with their Armor rating x 2 (see Barriers). Note that unlike other spells, Indirect Combat spells may affect other targets that the caster cannot see if they are caught within the spell’s area of effect.

**Elemental Effects**: Many Indirect Combat spells utilize damaging elemental energies such as Fire damage, Electrical damage, etc (see Damage Types).

Spells with elemental components also create secondary effects on the environment. For example, a Fireball might start fires, cook off ammo, ignite fuel tanks, and set fire to armor and clothing all over the blast zone. An Acid Stream can melt surrounding material into smoking sludge. These are noted in the special case damage descriptions.

**Damage Value**: The base Damage Value for Combat spells is based on Force in flat damage, which is chosen by the magician at the time of casting. Any Effect scored on the Spellcasting Test increase the Damage Value by 1D6 per Effect. Each spell description notes whether damage is Stun (S) or Physical (P).

### Detection Spells

Detection also known as Divination spells give the subject a new sense, beyond the normal five senses, for as long as they are maintained. They are cast upon either the magician or a subject within Touch range. Using the sense may require the subject to take a Simple Action to Perception in Detail. Detection spells are either directional (like normal sight), area effect (work in all directions at once, like hearing), or psychic (providing some other special “sense” such as telepathy or precognition). Additionally the sense is either active or passive (see below).

**Active**: The sense actively analyzes or seeks out certain information when the subject concentrates on it. Active Detection spells are treated as an Opposed Test, pitting the caster’s `Spellcasting + Magic vs. The target’s Willpower (+ Counterspelling, if available)`; magical objects resist with Force. Against objects, handle the spell as a Success Test with a {TN} based on the Object Resistance. The Detection Spell Results table provides guidelines for how thoroughly the sense works, based on Effect scored. Note that Counterspelling may be used to defend against active Detection spells, even if the magician is not aware of them (see Counterspelling).

**Passive**: A passive sense is simply “on” and passes along any appropriate sensory input without any sort of interpretation (similar to hearing). The Spellcasting Test serves as a magical Willpower test, against an appropriate {TN} determined by the gamemaster. Other effects are noted in the spell descriptions. The Detection Spell Results table provides guidelines for how thoroughly the sense works, based on Effect.

Note that Counterspelling cannot be used to “defend” against the sense provided by passive Detection spells.

**Range**: The standard sensory range for a Detection spell is the spell’s `Force x Magic` in yards. For extended range Detection spells, the effective range of the new sense is `Force x Magic x 10 yards`. Note that any of the standard range spells listed below may be learned with an extended range instead (adding +2 FV).

Note also that a separate test is not needed for each potential target in range of the sense. The character simply makes a single `Spellcasting + Magic Test` and compares the results against each potential target in range, using the Detection Spell Results table to determine the result. If a caster sustains a Detection spell, new targets may be detected as they enter the range of the spell; in this case, the gamemaster simply applies the results of the original `Spellcasting + Magic Test` to see if the new targets are noticed.

**Glitches**: A glitch on a Detection Spellcasting Test may result in false or misleading information. Likewise, a critical glitch may inflict extra (+2 FV) or Physical Drain, may temporarily strip the character of a sense, or may inexplicably apply the sense to others (particularly opponents) in range.

**Detection Results Table**
| {TN} | Results                                                                                                                                     |

#### Analyze Device (Active, Directional)
- Type: P 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2)

This spell allows the subject to analyze the purpose and operation of a device or piece of equipment within range of the sense. The caster must gain enough hits on the Spellcasting Test to beat the item’s Object Resistance. Each Effect gives the subject a +1 while operating the device, and allows the subject to ignore any skill defaulting modifiers for using the device while the spell is sustained.


#### Analyze Truth (Active, Directional)
- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2)

The subject can tell whether a target’s statements are the truth. Halftruths or falsehoods the target believes to be true are not detected by this spell.

The subject must hear a statement in person (with the target within range) to know whether it is true.

#### Clairaudience (Passive, Directional)
- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) –1

The subject can hear distant sounds as if physically present at a chosen point within the sensory range of the spell. The “listening point” may be moved to any other point within range of the spell. While using clairaudience, the subject cannot use her normal hearing. This spell does not translate visual images, only sounds (and only sounds within the subject’s natural range of hearing; augmented hearing does not apply).

#### Clairvoyance (Passive, Directional)
- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) –1

The subject can see distant scenes as if physically present at a chosen point within the sensory range of the spell. The “visual point” may be moved to any other point within range of the spell. The subject cannot use normal vision or astral perception while using it. This spell does not translate sound, only vision. Any augmented vision possessed by the subject does not function through this spell, nor does astral perception. Magicians cannot use clairvoyance to target others with spells.

#### Combat Sense (Active, Psychic)
- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 2

The subject can subconsciously analyze combat and other dangerous situations within range, sensing events a split-second before they happen. Every Effect on the Spellcasting Test adds +1 Reaction on Surprise Tests and when defending against ranged and melee attacks for the duration of the spell.

The subject can detect living targets within range who have hostile intentions toward him. The spell does not detect traps (since they are not alive), nor can it detect someone about to shoot into a crowd at random (the hostility is not directed at the subject of the spell). The spell can detect targets preparing an ambush or other surprise attack.

#### Detect Individual (Active, Area)
- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) – 1

The subject can detect the presence of a particular individual anywhere within range of the sense. The magician names the individual during casting; she must know the target or have met him in the past.

- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) –1

#### Detect [Life Form], Extended (Active, Extended Area)
- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) +1

The subject detects all of a specified type of life form within the range of the sense and knows their number and relative location. Each different life form requires a separate spell (Detect Orcs, Detect Elves, Detect Dragons, and so forth).

#### Detect Magic (Active, Area)

The subject can detect the presence of all foci, spells, wards, magical lodges, and spirits within range of the sense. It does not detect Awakened characters or critters, astral signatures, or the effects of permanent spells once they have become permanent.

#### Detect [Object] (Active, Area)
- Type: P 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) –1

The subject detects all of a specified type of object within range of the sense and knows their number and relative location. Each type of object requires a separate spell (Detect Guns, Detect Computers, Detect Explosives, and so forth).

#### Mindlink (Active, Psychic)
- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1

Mindlink allows the caster and one voluntary subject to communicate mentally, exchanging conversation, emotions, and mental images. One Effect on the Spellcasting Test is enough to establish the link. The subject must remain within range of the spellcaster for the Mindlink to work.

#### Mind Probe (Active, Directional)
- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 2

This spell allows the subject to telepathically probe the mind of a specific target within range of the sense (chosen when the spell is cast). The target is aware of the probing, though they may not know the source of the spell. If the caster gains one or more Effect, consult the Mind Probe Results table (below) for the information gained. The subject may probe for one piece of information per Complex Action. Additional uses of Mind Probe against the same target within a number of hours equal to the target’s Willpower are at a –2 modifier per previous Spellcasting attempt.

**Mind Probe Results table**
| {TN} | Result                                                                                                     |

| 20   | The subject can fi nd out anything the target consciously knows and view the target’s memories.            |
| 25   | The subject can probe the target’s subconscious, for psychological quirks, deep fears, or hidden memories. |

### Physical Health Spells

Physical Health spells can heal physical injury, cure diseases (or inflict them), detoxify poisons or drugs (or mimic their effects), as well as modify attributes. No techniques currently known to magic can erase Stun damage or cure psychological conditions.

All health spells require the caster to touch the subject of the spell. This “laying on hands” is traditional in magical healing lore the world over. Physical Health spells are handled as Success Tests, with Effect providing specified bonuses.

Negative Physical Health spells: Spells that negatively affect a character require an Opposed Test, pitting `Spellcasting + Magic vs. The target’s appropriate attribute (+ Counterspelling, if available)`.

#### Antidote

- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: P 
- FV: (Toxin DV) – 2

This spell helps a poisoned subject to overcome a toxin. It must be applied before the toxin does damage (though an Antidote spell applied afterward may alleviate some side effects, if the gamemaster chooses). The poisoned character receives a modifier on her Toxin Resistance Test (Stamina) equal to the Effect. 

#### Cure Disease

- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: P 
- FV: (Disease DV) – 2

This spell is used at any point after infection to help a patient overcome illness. The infected character receives a number of additional dice on her Disease Resistance Test equal to the spell’s Effect. It does not heal any damage already inflicted by the disease (that takes a separate Healing spell).

#### Decrease [Attribute] (Negative)

- Type: P 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1

This spell weakens the target by decreasing a chosen attribute. A version of this spell exists for each Physical and Mental attribute, but not for Special attributes (Initiative, Courage, Magic). It affects both natural and augmented attributes. The target resists the spell using the attribute affected. If the caster wins, the attribute is reduced by the spell’s Effect. If a Physical attribute is reduced to 0, the victim is incapacitated or paralyzed. If a Mental attribute is reduced to 0, the victim stands about mindlessly confused. Note that decreasing an attribute may affect other derived statistics.

#### Detox

- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: P 
- FV: (Toxin DV) – 4

Detox relieves the side effects of a drug or poison. The Force of the spell must equal or exceed the toxin’s base DV. A single Effect is sufficient to eliminate all symptoms. Detox does not heal or prevent damage done by toxins, but it eliminates any side effects they may have on the victim (dizziness, hallucinations, nausea, pain, and so forth). Detox is the hangover cure of choice among those who can afford it. 

#### Heal

- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: P 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) – 2

Heal repairs physical injuries. It heals an amount of Physical damage equal to the spell’s `Force + Effect from the Spellcasting Test`. Effect can also be used to reduce the base time for the spell to become permanent; each Effect spent this way shaves off 1 Combat Turn. A character can only be magically healed once for any single set of injuries. 

#### Hibernate

- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) – 3

The caster must touch a voluntary or unconscious subject. The spell puts the subject in a form of suspended animation. The subject’s bodily processes are slowed by a factor equal to the Effect. For example, If the Effect was 4, the subject’s metabolism is slowed by a factor of 4. Such a subject sealed into a chamber with enough air to keep it alive for a day would be able to last four days.

#### Increase [Attribute]

- Type: P 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) – 2

This spell increases an attribute (natural or augmented) on a voluntary subject. A version of this spell exists for each Physical and Mental attribute, but not for Special attributes (Initiative, Courage, Magic). The Force of the spell must equal or exceed the (augmented) value of the attribute being affected. The attribute is increased by an amount equal to the Effect scored. Each attribute can only be affected by a single Increase Attribute spell at a time.

Note that increasing an attribute may affect other derived statistics (Increase Reaction also affects Initiative, for example, while Increase Stamina will add extra boxes to the character’s Physical Condition Monitor for as long as the spell lasts).

#### Increase Reflexes

- Type: P 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 2

This spell increases the reflexes (Initiative) of a voluntary subject. Each level of increase adds +1 Initiative. The caster must achieve a certain Effect TN for each level:

- Effect 2: +1 Initiative
- Effect 3: +2 Initiative, +1 Complex Action
- Effect 4 (max.): +3 Initiative, +2 Complex Actions

A character can only be affected by a single Increase Reflexes spell at a time.

#### Oxygenate

- Type: P 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) – 1

This spell oxygenates the blood of a voluntary subject, providing extra Stamina (+1 for every Effect) to resist suffocation, strangulation, the effects of inhaled gas, or any other effect of oxygen deprivation. The spell also allows the subject to breathe underwater.

#### Prophylaxis

- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) – 2

This spell provides additional Stamina (+1 per Effect) for a voluntary subject to resist infection, drugs, or toxins. The spell does not discriminate between harmful and beneficial drugs, so the subject also resists medicines and other helpful drugs while under the effects of the spell.  Reduce the effect of a beneficial drug by 1 for every Effect of the spell. Two or more Effect prevent the subject from being affected by alcohol while under the effect of this spell.

#### Resist Pain

- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: P 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) – 4

This spell allows the caster to have the same affect of the High Pain Threshold Edge for a number of rounds equal to the Force + Effect of the Spellcasting Test. 


#### Stabilize

- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: P 
- FV: (Overflow damage) – 2

When applied to a character who is at Physical Health 0 and dying, this spell stabilizes all vital functions and prevents the character from dying. The spell’s Force must equal or exceed the overflow damage already taken when the spell starts. The full time must be taken for the spell to become Permanent before the character is stabilized; Effect reduce the time it takes by 1 Combat Turn each. If successful, the spell prevents the character from taking further damage from Physical Damage Overflow.

### Illusion Spells

No matter how realistic they are, illusions cannot directly cause permanent harm. They can cause distractions, loss of balance or orientation, and even symptoms like nausea or pain. All such effects vanish as soon as the caster drops the illusion. Illusions can certainly cause harm by manipulating the senses so a victim walks into traffic or off a high building, for example, but they cannot directly cause damage.

Obvious illusions are used solely for entertainment and cannot fool subjects into believing they are real. Realistic illusions seem completely real. Single-sense illusions affect only one sense. Full sensory illusions affect all senses. Though mana-based illusions can be created on the astral plane, their magical auras give them away as illusions to anyone who makes a successful Assensing Test (see Astral Willpower). Illusions cannot fool assensing to disguise or create auras.

Mana Illusions: Mana-based illusion spells affect the mind and are ineffective against technological viewing systems like cameras. Mana illusions are resisted by Willpower + Counterspelling (if any). Some mana illusions affect the target’s senses directly, others affect the senses of anyone perceiving the subject of the spell (though the spellcaster is not affected by her own spell). 

Physical Illusions: Physical illusion spells create actual images or alter physical properties, such as light or sound. Physical illusions are effective against technological systems, assuming the caster achieves enough Effect to meet the Object Resistance TN. They are resisted by `Intuition + Counterspelling (if any)`; non-living devices do not get a resistance test. The spellcaster must generate more Effect than the observer for the illusion to be considered real. If the spell is not completely resisted, the character is fully affected by the illusion.

#### Confusion (Realistic, Multi-Sense)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2)


#### Mass Confusion (Realistic, Multi-Sense, Area)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 2


#### Chaos (Realistic, Multi-Sense)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1


#### Chaotic World (Realistic, Multi-Sense, Area)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 3


These spells produce a storm of conflicting sensations and images to confuse the senses. For each Effect on the Spellcasting Test, the target suffers a –1 modifier to all tests from the distraction. Confusion affects a single target. Mass Confusion is an area spell. The Chaos spell is a physical version of Confusion (above), so it also affects technological systems and sensing devices. Chaotic World is an area version of Chaos.

#### Entertainment (Obvious, Multi-Sense, Area)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1


#### Trid Entertainment (Obvious, Multi-Sense, Area)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 2


These area spells create obvious, but entertaining, illusions. Effect on the Spellcasting Test measure how creative, interesting, and captivating the audience finds the illusion. The caster can reproduce just about anything from her imagination, or re-create something she has experienced. The gamemaster might require additional hits for exacting detail. 

Entertainment affects the minds of the subjects and cannot be detected by non-living sensors. Trid Entertainment is a physical spell, and can be perceived by both living subjects and non-living sensors. These spells are used for amusement as well as art. The entertainment industry uses illusionists as literal “special effects wizards.” Magical designers and artists work to create new and interesting sensations, including sensations that can’t otherwise be experienced in the real world. Only the wealthy can afford the unique experiences offered by such spellcasters firsthand.

#### Invisibility (Realistic, Single-Sense)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2)


#### Improved Invisibility (Realistic, Single-Sense)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1


This spell makes the subject more difficult to detect by normal visual senses (including low-light, thermographic, and other senses that rely on the visual spectrum). The subject is completely tangible and detectable by the other senses (hearing, smell, touch, etc.). Her aura is still visible to astral perception. 

Anyone who might perceive the subject must first successfully resist the spell. Simply make one Spellcasting Test and use the result scored as the TN for anyone that resists at a later point. Even if the spell is resisted, the subject might remain unnoticed if she wins a Sneaking Test. An invisible character may still be detected by non-visual means, such as hearing or smell. Attacks against invisible targets suffer the Target Hidden modifier (disadvantage) if the attacker is unable to see or otherwise sense the subject of the spell. Invisibility affects the minds of viewers. Improved invisibility creates an actual warping of light around the subject that affects technological sensors as well.


This spell makes the subject more difficult to detect

by normal visual senses (including low-light, thermo-
graphic, and other senses that rely on the visual spec-
trum). The subject is completely tangible and detectable

by the other senses (hearing, smell, touch, and even

taste, if it somehow comes to that). Her aura is still visi-
ble to astral perception.

Anyone who might be in a position to perceive the
subject must first successfully resist the spell. Simply
make one Spellcasting Test and use the hits scored as
the TN for anyone that resists at a later point.
Even if the spell is resisted, the subject might remain
undetected if she’s good enough with her Sneaking Test. An invisible character may still be detected by non-visual means, such as hearing or smell. Attacks against invisible targets suffer the Blind Fire modifier if the attacker is unable to see or otherwise sense the subject of the spell.

Invisibility affects the minds of viewers. Improved Invisibility mimics the subject’s surroundings from all angles and affects technological sensors as well.

#### Mask (Realistic, Multi-Sense)

- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2)


#### Physical Mask (Realistic, Multi-Sense)

- Type: P 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1


The Mask spell requires the caster to touch the subject. The subject assumes a different physical appearance (of the same basic size and shape) chosen by the caster. This alters the subject’s voice, scent, and other physical characteristics as well. Anyone who might see through the disguise must first successfully resist the spell. Simply make one Spellcasting Test and use the result scored as the {TN} for anyone that resists at a later point.

Mask affects the minds of viewers. Physical Mask creates an illusion that affects technological sensors as well.

#### Phantasm (Realistic, Multi-Sense, Area)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) +2


#### Trid Phantasm (Realistic, Multi-Sense, Area)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) +3


These area spells create convincing illusions of any object, creature, or scene the caster desires. They can create an illusion of anything the caster has seen before, from a flower or a credstick to a dragon breathing fire, as long as the illusion is no larger than the spell’s area. Anyone who might pierce the illusion must successfully resist the spell. Simply make one Spellcasting Test and use the result as the TN for anyone that resists at a later point. Phantasm only affects living beings, while Trid Phantasm affects technological sensors as well. 

#### Hush (Realistic, Single-Sense, Area)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 2


#### Silence (Realistic, Single-Sense, Area)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 3


These spells create an area that damps sound. Sonic attacks into or out of the field, as well as critter powers using a sonic medium (such as Paralyzing Howl), are reduced by –1 per Effect on the Spellcasting Test. Anyone attempting to hear a sound from within or across the silenced area must successfully resist the spell.

Hush is a mana spell and so only affects living beings and magic sonic attacks. Silence affects technological devices and is useful for jamming alarms, detection devices, sonar, and tactical communications, as well as technological sonic weapons.

#### Sneaking (Realistic, Single-Sense)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) +1


Sneaking makes the subject less audible to normal hearing (including augmented hearing). The subject moves in silence, making less or no noise. Things not directly touched by the subject can still make noise, so a character under a Sneaking spell would make no noise knocking on a door, but the door would make noise hitting the floor or wall if it was kicked in.

Anyone who might hear the subject must first successfully resist the spell. Simply make one Spellcasting Test and use the result scored as the TN for anyone that resists at a later point. Even if the spell is resisted, the subject might remain unnoticed if she wins a Shadowing or Infiltration Test.

### Manipulation Spells

Manipulation spells control, animate, or transform matter and energy.
Many Manipulation spells have a TN; this is the number of
Spellcasting + Magic hits required for the spell to function. Mental
Manipulations affect the mind, Physical Manipulations affect physical
forms, and Environmental Manipulations affect conditions such as
light, temperature, gravity, etc. Most Manipulation spells are handled
as Success Tests, with hits determining the effect.

Mental Manipulations: For Mental Manipulation spells, the caster makes an Opposed Spellcasting + Magic Test against the target’s Willpower (+ Counterspelling, if available). If the caster scores more hits, she controls the target as noted in the spell description. Every (Force) Combat Turns, the victim may spend a Complex Action to shake off the mental control. the victim rolls a Willpower (+ Counterspelling) Test; each hit reduces the Effect on the caster’s original Spellcasting Test. If the spellcaster’s Effect are reduced to 0, the spell no longer affects the target.

#### Armor (Physical)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S

protects against Physical damage. It provides both Ballistic and Impact
armor (cumulative with worn armor) to the subject equal to the hits scored. 

#### Control Actions (Mental)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2)

#### Mob Control (Mental, Area)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 2

the caster of this spell controls the physical actions of a target like a puppeteer pulling strings. the victim’s consciousness is unaffected, but the
caster controls the victim’s body. the target uses any skills or abilities at
the caster’s orders, but these tests suffer a  modifier equal to the
target’s Willpower because of the victim’s resistance to the caster’s commands. Controlling a target character requires the caster to spend a Simple
Action; when not directly controlled, the victim may act as normal.
Control Actions only affects a single target, Mob Control affects
any living targets within the area of effect. Victims of a Mob Control
may be manipulated individually (with separate Simple Actions) or
issued the same command as a group (with a single Simple Action).

#### Control Emotions (Mental)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2)

#### Mob Mood (Mental, Area)

- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 2

the target feels an overwhelming emotion chosen by the spellcaster (such
as love, hate, fear, joy, sorrow, and so forth). the target believes the emotion
wholeheartedly, but not mindlessly. A target who acts in accordance with
the emotion (for example, fighting while filled with anger or hate) suffers
no penalty. If the target takes action not relevant to the emotion (trying
to drive while laughing hysterically), she suffers a –2  modifier
for the distraction. the caster may switch emotions with a Simple Action.
Control Emotions only affects a single target, Mob Mood affects
any living targets within the area of effect.

#### Control Thoughts (Mental)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS

the caster seizes control of the target’s mind, directing everything the
target does. the caster mentally gives commands with a Simple Action
and the target is compelled to obey

Control thoughts affects a single target, while Mob Mind affects
any living targets within the area of effect. Victims of a Mob Mind may
be manipulated individually (with separate Simple Actions) or issued
the same command as a group (with a single Simple Action)

#### Fling (Physical)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: I 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1

this spell psychokinetically hurls a single object of no more than
(Force) pounds at a designated target with a Strength equal to onehalf the spellcaster’s Magic. Treat the Spellcasting Test as a normal
Ranged Combat Test for the purposes of the item hitting the target.
throwing weapons propelled by this spell use their normal range based
on the spell’s effective Strength.

#### Ice Sheet (Environmental, Area)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: I 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 3

This spell creates a slippery sheet of ice over the area of effect.
Characters crossing the ice must make an Agility + Reaction Test with
a TN equal to the hits scored to avoid falling prone. Vehicles
must make a Crash Test. the sheet melts at a rate of 1 square
yard per minute in normal temperatures.

#### Ignite (Physical)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: P 
- FV: (F ÷ 2)

the Ignite spell accelerates molecular motion in the target, causing it
to catch fire once the spell becomes permanent. the spellcaster must
achieve enough Effect to beat a TN equal to the target’s Object
Resistance. Once the target ignites, it burns normally until it
is consumed or extinguished.
Against living targets, treat Ignite as an Opposed Test pitting
Spellcasting + Magic vs. Stamina (+ Counterspelling). If successful,
Ignite wraps a living target in heat and flames once it has been made
permanent, causing (Force) boxes of Fire damage on the first
Combat Turn, and increasing by one box of damage each additional
turn. Resolve the damage at the end of each Combat Turn by making
a Damage Resistance Test using the victim’s Stamina + half Impact armor.
Ammo or explosives carried by a victim may go off. the gamemaster
should reduce the Force of the fire accordingly for extinguishing efforts 



#### Influence (Mental)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: P 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1

this spell implants a single suggestion in the victim’s mind, like a powerful post-hypnotic command. the subject will carry out this suggestion as if it were her own idea and it will then fade. If confronted with
the wrongness of the suggestion, the subject can make a Willpower
Test to overcome it as described under Mental Manipulations.
the caster can also withdraw the suggestion at any time.

#### Levitate (Physical)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1

Levitate allows the caster to telekinetically lift a person or object and
move it around. the caster must achieve a TN on the Spellcasting
Test equal to 1 per 200 kg of the subject’s mass. the subject of the spell
can be moved anywhere in the caster’s line of sight at a Movement rate
equal to the spell’s Force x net Spellcasting hits in yards per turn.
Objects flung into other things should be handled as a Ranged
Attack Test (see Fling), inflicting a number of boxes of Stun damage as
decided by the gamemaster (especially sharp or dangerous objects may
do Physical damage at the gamemaster’s discretion).

If the caster is attempting to levitate an item held by a living being,
make an Opposed Test between the spell’s Force x 2 and the holder’s
Strength + Stamina. the caster must have at least 1 net hit to levitate the
item away. If the caster is attempting to levitate an unwilling living
being, the Opposed Test uses the target’s Strength + Stamina. You can use
this spell to levitate yourself, if desired.

#### Light (Environmental, Area)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) – 1

this spell creates a mobile point of light, illuminating a radius around
it equal to the spell’s Force in yards. the spell cannot be used to

Spellcasting Test counters a –1 die penalty for visibility.

#### Magic Fingers (Physical)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1

Magic Fingers creates a psychokinetic effect like “invisible hands” that
can hold or manipulate items. the hits on the Spellcasting + Magic
Test become the spell’s effective Strength and Agility. the caster can use
skills remotely with Magic Fingers, but all tests receive a –2 
modifier due to problems of fine control. Even simple actions like picking up a coin may require an Agility Test, at the gamemaster’s discretion.
the caster can fight, pick a lock, or perform any other action,
using the magic fingers as if they were real hands. the spell can reach
any point the caster can see, and Clairvoyance or remote-viewing technology can be used to get a close-up of the scene as long as it is within
the caster’s normal line of sight. this spell comes in very handy for disarming bombs and handling other hazardous work from a safe distance.

#### Mana Barrier (Environmental, Area)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1

Mana Barrier creates an invisible barrier of magical energy with a Force
equal to the Effect scored. this barrier does not restrict living beings
or physical objects, but it does impede spirits, foci, dual beings, and
spells. If cast on the astral plane, it also impedes astral forms and restricts visibility. Any target of a spell that is on the other side of the
Mana Barrier receives a bonus to its spell resistance  equal to
the barrier’s Force. If the target had no resistance , but instead
has an Object Resistance TN, increase the TN by 1 for
every increment of 3 Force in the Mana Barrier (round up). 

#### Petrify (Physical)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 2

Petrify transforms living tissue into stone-like calcium carbonate. the
caster must win an Opposed Test pitting her Spellcasting + Magic

Force must equal or exceed the target’s Stamina. Non-living material—
including clothing, gear, and cyberware—is not affected. the target
is not conscious while under the effects of this spell, and any damage
suffered by the stone-like form affects the target normally. While petrified, the subject has a barrier Armor rating equal to Stamina + Effect
(see Barriers).

#### Physical Barrier (Environmental, Area)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 3

Barrier spells create glowing, translucent force-fields with both 1 point
of Armor and Structure rating per hit (see Barriers). the caster
can form the barrier as a dome with a radius and height equal to the 
spell’s normal radius. the caster can also form a wall with a height and
length equal to the spell’s Force. the caster can adjust size of the barrier
the same as the radius of an area spell .
Physical Barrier creates a physical wall. Anything the size of a molecule (or less) can pass through the barrier, including air or other gases.
Anything bigger treats the barrier as a normal physical wall. Attacks
directed through a barrier have a –1  visibility penalty. the
barrier does not impede spells. the barrier can be brought down by
physical attacks, but as long as it is sustained it regenerates damage
quickly—any reductions in Structure Rating are restored at the beginning of the next Combat Turn. If the barrier is penetrated, however,
it collapses and the spell ends. Physical Barrier cannot be used on the
astral plane.

#### Poltergeist (Environmental, Area)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 3

2 boxes of Stun damage (resisted with Reaction + Impact armor) to
anyone in the area each Combat Turn, whacking them with flying
debris. Poltergeist may do more damage in cluttered environments, or

Shapechange transforms a voluntary subject into a normal (non-paranormal) critter, though the subject retains human consciousness. the
subject can only assume the form of a critter whose base Stamina rating
is 2 points greater or less than her own. Consult the Critters section, for the subject’s Physical attributes while in critter form. Add 1
to the critter’s Base attribute Ratings for every hit the caster generates.
Her Mental attributes remain unchanged.
this spell does not transform clothing and equipment. Magicians
in critter form can still cast spells, but cannot perform other tasks requiring speech.
Critter form works like the Shapechange spell, but only allows the
