## What is SIRE?

SIRE is a 3d6 TTRPG system created by CJ Schrum to be a generic system used to play any kind of TTRPG. It was influenced by his near thirty years of table top games in nearly every ruleset created. 

> I used to play FATE I liked a lot of things about FATE, I hated FATE dice mechanics. I played a lot of Cepheus, Traveller, Decipher Star Trek, ModernAGE, West End Games Star Wars, and Sixfinity so lets say I have a lot of experience with D6 in my hands. So I set out to create a fairly generic style RPG using 3D6 (I like the curve better than the standard distribution of 2D6). Allowing for Advanatage Roll 3D6 twice take highest, and Disadvantage Roll 3D6 twice take the lowest. They also have Edge Points they can spend.
> Combat is meant to be cinematic in style with a tactical flavor. Characters have Physical Health.

## Chapter 1: Character Creation 
{{Write a Definition}}

### Attributes

There are eight attributes and two special attributes.

---

**Physical Attributes**

---


**Body**

This represents the general sturdiness, integrity, and health of the individual. It sometimes is correlated to size—trolls tend to have high Body ratings— but this is not a perfect correlation, as dwarfs tend to have higher Body ratings than humans. Body’s uses include resisting damage and toxins.

**Agility**

Agility represents fine motor control—manual dexterity, flexibility, balance, and coordination. A character with a low Agility may be someone with an inner-ear problem, one leg that is shorter than the other, or a simple klutz. Higher Agility ratings may belong to charac- ters that are “natural” athletes.

**Reaction**

A character’s Reaction is, quite simply, her physical reflexes—how quickly she can react to a changing situation, and how well she can dodge the physical slings and arrows that shadowrunning brings. A character with a high Reaction is more likely to be on top of a situation and will be in a better position to react to danger, while low-Reaction characters will lag behind.

**Strength**

Strength denotes what a character’s muscles can do, including things such as raw lifiing power and running speed. Strength is some- what dependent on a character’s size and metatype. If your character is a 5’3” tall, 115-pound human girl, she’s unlikely to possess an un- augmented Strength attribute of 6. On the other hand, dwarfs have a muscle density that rivals that of reptiles. Characters with low Strength may be small, skinny, or slight, or simply too busy to work out. A high- Strength character may be tough and wiry, know how to use her body to her best advantage, work out every day, or simply be fraggin’ BIG.

---

***Mental Attributes**

**Charisma**

Charisma is a nebulous attribute. More than just looks, Charisma rep- resents a character’s personal aura, self-image, ego, willingness to find out what people want and give it to them, and ability to recognize what she can and can’t get out of people. A whiny demeanor, a me-first attitude, or an inability to read body language or subtle hints are just a few traits that can give a character low Charisma. A character with high Charisma might simply enjoy entertaining others, may excel at making friends and/or manipulating people, or may be all flash and fun with whomever it is today. A high-Charisma character might deliver jokes at the right moment, have a sexy way of carrying herself, or com- mand respect because her timing is always impeccable.

**Intuition**

Intuition covers “mental alertness”—the ability to take in and process information, to read a crowd, to assess a situation for danger or opportunity. A character with little Intuition may be unobservant, may rarely think things fully through, or could simply be “slow.” A character with a high Intuition is adept at making the best of a bad situation, knowing when to leave before an encounter escalates, noticing small clues, and working from instinct.

**Logic**

Logic represents a character’s memorizing ability and raw brain- power. It denotes how fast a character learns, how much she can re- member, and how well she can execute pre-planned sequences. A Logic-lacking character might get overwhelmed when confronted with a lot of details and may have a poor memory—especially for facts and figures. Characters with a high Logic rating will likely be excellent book-learners, able to deal with computer and magic theory with ease, and capable of building (and tearing down!) machinery and electronics. 


**Willpower**

Willpower keeps a character going when she wants to give up, or enables her to control her habits and emotions. Willpower determines whether or not a character is going to take charge of her life. A charac- ter with low Willpower might defer to other people when big decisions are being made, for example. A high-Willpower character is more as- sured and possesses a never-say-die streak. Such characters go down to the monowire because that’s exactly the fragging point. Willpower also represents a character’s cool under fire, her ability to resist intimida- tion and manipulation, and her resolve to stick to her guns when the
pressure is on.

---

**Special Attributes**

Please note Resonance is not used in Sixfinity if it is referenced ignore it.

**Magic**

Not all characters have this attribute; it is only for magic-using characters, who are generally referred to as Awakened characters. It measures their strength in channeling mana into spectacular effects.

**Edge**

This critical statistic measures the undefinable, putting it on tricky ground right at the outset. It is that combination of guts, risk, and heedless ignorance of danger and good sense that lets shadowrunners survive where others do not. Edge is detailed and important enough to have its own section


**Essence**

All characters have this attribute, starting at 6. It is a measure of how many augmentations characters can hold. The metahuman body can only contain so much ’ware before it loses the small spark that separates a living being from a machine. This attribute primarily exists due to the degrees of difference between biology and technology—it simply does not flow well through technology and becomes limited as your Essence declines (specifically, anytime your Essence goes below any whole integer, you lose a corresponding point of Magic or Resonance). Also, some magic, particularly healing magic, has less of an effect on you as you gain more augmentations. Finally, if your Essence ever reaches 0, you die


---


### Priority System

In Sixfinity character generation is based on the Priority System. The Priority System is a table with the following columns: Metatype, Attributes, Magic, Skills, and Resources. The rows are divided into Priority Levels ranging from Priority A to Priority E. Players assign a specific Priority Level for each of the columns to their character depending on their preferences. The values assigned must be different for each column (representing each aspect of the character), and there can be no duplications. For example, a character may not have Priority Level B for Magic and Priority B for Resources. The higher the Priority Level (A, B, etc.), the more valuable it is for the character. Characters use Experience later on to customize their characters even further.

The player begins the character-creation process by choosing their character’s metatype, or metatype. There are five distinct races within the core Sixfinity system, gamemasters are welcome to add or replace them: dwarfs, elves, humans, orcs, and fomori. Each metatype receives different racial advantages (and possibly disadvantages). Humans, for example, receive a higher rating in Edge (+1). Formions receive Thermographic Vision, +1 Reach (1 square), and Dermal Armor, but they also have the disadvantage of having their Lifestyle costs doubled to reflect the costs of adapting everything they use—especially their gear, to meet their massive physical requirements. Several metatype also receive physical or mental advantages/disadvantages to their attribute ratings (such as higher or lower natural attribute limits). When determining which metatype best fits the character concept they wish to play, the player should refer to the Metatype Attribute Table (below) and review the specific details for each metatype.

Once the player has selected the metatype they wish to play, they should review the Metatype column to determine which Priority Levels give them the best options for their character based on their preferred metatype and the special attribute points they need. The special attributes are Edge, and Magic; if you want your character to have a high rating in one or more of these areas, make sure you select a row with plenty of special attribute points.

Regardless of Priority all starting characters get 25 Experience to spend on their character to flesh them out, make then unique.

**Priority System Table**

Final Touches and Derived Stats.

### Derived Stats

#### Defense
We use Defense Rolls to Defend Attacks. 

Defense = Reaction + Intuition

#### Attack Rating

When a character goes on the offensive, their chosen weapon has a combination of traits that determine it's overall effectiveness. This combination of stopping power, accuracy, and recoil compensation (for firearms) is captured in the Attack Rating. Characters add their Strength to the Attack Rating for melee weapons and the Attack Rating for unarmed combat is Strength + Reaction.

#### Defense Rating

This stat is an important part of combat, representing how well the character and their worn armor resist incoming attacks. It is a combination of Body, worn armor, and other effects, including augmentations and magic. This is used to calculate combat advantage and toughness

Defense Rating = Body + Armor

#### Physical Health

Physical Health = ([Body / 2] + 8) x3

This is your Physical Health. If it reach zero you are bleeding to death. You will start at 0 and lose 1 point per round you are not stabalized. You can go into the negative equal to your Overflow. 

For Example Jared is hit by a Shotgun for 13. Jared only had 10 Physical left. So Jared drops to 0 and is Incapacitated. The next round Jared drops to -1, Jared has a Body of 5 so he can bleed until he is at -10 once he ticks to -11 he is dead. 

> I will send you to a place where no amount of clapping will bring you back

#### Stun Health

Stun Health = ([Willpower / 2] + 8) x3

This is where Stun Damage is recorded. If it reaches 0 you start taking Physical Damage and you are at Disadvantage to most Tests until you take a Breather (see Healing). 

#### Overflow

This is how far into the Negatives you can go before you die. 

Overflow = Body X 2

#### Toughness

Toughness is a measure of how well prepared you are to take a blow, or to encourage it to miss you. It is used in virtually all combat situations. Some qualities and gear may affect this.

Toughness = [Defense Rating] /4 round up

If you have a Defense Rating of 11 that would be a Toughness of 3.

#### Movement

Base movement for any character is 10 Yards.

#### Initiative

Initiative is used to determine who goes first in combat. Add your Reaction + Intuition for your base, then write how many Initiative Dice you have. You start with a default of 1; this may be increased by augmentations. It looks like this when written: 9 + 1D6

Initiative = Reaction + Intuition + 1D6

#### Edge Points

List your Edge Rating after character creation.

#### Composure (Willpower + Charisma)

When the stress is running hot, the gamemaster can call for a test to see if you keep your cool. The gamemaster sets the threshold, and the player makes the roll to see if they stay engaged or start freaking out. Note that repeated exposure to certain types of situations reduces the need for Composure tests in those situations

#### Judge Intentions (Willpower + Intuition)

Sometimes you just need a roll to get a read on someone. The Judge Intentions test is just that. Once you’ve had enough time to get a read on someone (as judged by the gamemaster), you can make a roll to help fill in your basic attitude and feelings toward the target. Just remember that a good part of Mr. Johnson’s training is dedicated to getting you to trust them when you shouldn’t.

#### Memory (Logic + Intuition)

Most of us don’t remember our lives with one hundred percent clarity. We’re influenced by the mood at the time we formed a memory, the current mood, the presence or absence of memorable stimuli, or even slight oddities in the details. Then you have the tricks our mind plays in distorting memories to make us the heroes of our own story, and things get really weird. When it’s time to make a withdrawal from the memory bank, the gamemaster sets a threshold based on the age and complexity of the information, and you can roll to determine whether or not you recall the information you want. It may be about remembering a face, recalling a critical piece of information, pulling up a detail from the past that will help you understand what’s happening in front of you right now, or some other mental feat.

#### Lift/Carry (Body + Willpower)

As any professional powerlifter or crossfit champ will tell you, it’s not all in the muscles. You need the will to persevere in order to pull that little extra bit for the big efforts. Whether it’s pulling a comrade out of danger or flipping a car to cover your getaway, this is going to be the roll when there’s a question on whether or not it can be done. Characters can lift `[(Strength x Strength) x 20]` pounds naturally; if they need to raise the weight over their head, the multiplier drops to 10. Making a Lift/Carry test increases your effective Strength by 1 per net hit. It also does 1 Stun damage, resisted by Body. The damage increase by +1 each combat round you continue holding or carrying the weight.

### Character Advancement

In this game you spend your experience you gain at the end of the sessions to increase your charatcer during downtimes. 

Raising attributes is based on what the modifier not the base score. So to increase your Strength that is +3 to +4

| Desired Effect                               | XP Cost         |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------- |

## Chapter 2: Metatype

### Humans (homo sapiens sapiens)
- Average height: 5'6
- Average weight: 140 pounds
- Ears: Rounded
- Known for: Average size; average build; freaking out about people who don’t meet their averages
- Racial qualities: Humans have no extra racial qualities.

As the majority of the sentient beings of the world, humans create existing definitions of “normal,” and then some of them set out to abuse those definitions as hard as they can. These humans know that they lack the pure physical strength and social cohesion of some of the other metatypes, so they shape the world in a way that keeps the individuals they don’t like from ever realizing what they can do, and what they can become. The side effect of this, of course, is that many humans are caught up in the demoralizing machinery that the ruling corporate class has assembled, because they don’t fit into this artificial average. They are grist for the mill, people to be chewed up and spat out in the name of greater wealth and power for the people at the top. Because they’re humans, and there are so many of them, who’s going to notice how they’re ground down, and who is going to miss them when they’re gone? The shadows are full of humans who could not find a way to be normal or average.

### Elves (homo sapiens nobilis)
- Average height: 1.9 yards
- Average weight: 80 kg
- Ears: Pointy
- Known for: Slender, lithe build; being attractive and knowing it
- Racial qualities: Elves have low-light vision

Perhaps the most infuriating thing about elves to the other metatypes is that you can resent them like hell, and they just won’t care. They have two prosperous nations—Tír na nÓg (formerly known as Ireland) and Tír Tairngire (in the western part of North America)—they have people in some of the most powerful positions in the world, and celebrities whose MeFeed hits are in the billions. They are envied, not looked down on. But plenty of elves know that this envy does not extend to every elf. If you’re an elf who is not rich, elegant, or graceful, you’re often viewed as a failure, someone who had all the gifts of life handed to them and somehow screwed them up. And it’s not just nonelves who hold this view. Never mind that you might have grown up poor, never mind what obstacles you had to face—people think you automatically had it easy because you’re an elf. But elf society is not easy to survive. The upper crust can be absolutely ruthless about enforcing their status quo, labeling those who don’t fit as malcontents and finding ways to cast them aside. The barrens of the major sprawls of the world have plenty of elves who were thrown out because they wouldn’t cave to what society wanted them to be. Their anger could burn the whole earth.

### Dwarfs (homo sapiens pumilionis)
Average height: 1.2 yards
- Average weight: 54 kg
- Ears: Slightly pointy
- Known for: Short size; stocky build; perseverance
- Racial qualities: Dwarfs have thermographic vision and toxin resistance.

Sixth World dwarfs are often accepted into mainstream society without being fully valued. The taller metatypes seem to be happiest when dwarfs fit the roles they have preconceived for them— sidekicks, drivers, mechanics, that sort of thing. It doesn’t help that their size helps them squeeze into vehicles that orks, humans, and elves might have difficulty with, ones that trolls couldn’t even consider using. Still, they get work and little direct hate. They’re treated nicely, but they can’t help but feel that they’re being, well, overlooked. Dwarfs across the globe are dedicated to showing that they cannot be ignored. Dwarf deckers, street samurai, covert ops specialists, faces, and more are popping up in the international shadows, and others underestimate them at their peril. The lack of heightened antipathy against dwarfs helped them assimilate in human communities better than other metatypes. This means that they do not have as many of their own enclaves as some of the other metatypes (it also doesn’t help that they don’t have access to whatever stream of revenue the elves tap into build their kingdoms). With the founding of the dwarf-centric Biloxi Technical Institute, southern Mississippi in the CAS is becoming a dwarf haven. What that will grow into and how that will shape the world is anyone’s guess.


### Orks (homo sapiens robustus)
- Average height: 1.9 yards
- Average weight: 128 kg
- Ears: Pointy- Known for: Big, powerful physique; tusks; constantly being seen as outsiders
- Racial qualities: Orks have low-light vision and the Built Tough (1) quality

Orks make people nervous, and people don’t like to be nervous. Their tusks, bone structure, and pointed ears mark them as something altogether else, and their strength and size clearly show the damage they could do. As humans have done for centuries, they address the thing they fear by pushing them aside, keeping orks from building collective strength, and crushing them with the sheer force of numbers. That approach works as long as you can keep fear stoked and have it immobilize the masses. Because if people can move past the fear and start to understand the deliberate injustice that has been forced on some groups, they separate themselves from society’s machine, and the number of people used to enforce oppression gets smaller. Oppressors aren’t especially good at developing new solutions to such problems— they usually just resort to oppressing harder. So while realization of the injustices they deal with is spreading, orks across the Sixth World are preparing for things to get worse so that they can survive and set about the work of making things better. They already have some enclaves carved out for themselves— Seattle’s Underground, Atlanta’s Sweetwater Creek, Dharavi in the Indian Union—and they hope those locales will be the starting points for societies that include orks instead of fearing them.


### Trolls (homo sapiens ingentis)
- Average height: 2.5 yards
- Average weight: 300 kg
- Ears: Slightly pointy, often hidden by horns
- Known for: Being so big, you guys. Just huge. And horns.
- Racial qualities: Trolls have thermographic vision, the Built Tough (2) quality, and dermal deposits (which provide +1 to trolls’ Defense Rating).

It’s not easy to live in a society where you look like the walking embodiment of everyone else’s nightmares. Being two to three times as large as everyone else doesn’t help much, either. It’s not a troll’s world, and most of the other residents of the world aren’t inclined to change that fact. Who wants to make space for imposing monsters? Trolls are going to have to force their way into a place in the world—of course, when they force their way in anywhere, they’re inevitably called vandals and destroyers. A significant number of trolls have looked at the way the deck is stacked against them and decided they don’t need to play the rest of the world’s game anymore. They’ll stand aside and watch the world burn—and maybe throw on an extra match every now and then. The Black Forest Troll Republic is one of the most important troll communities in the world, acting as a beacon and vision for what troll society can be while keeping a certain distance from everyone else. Whether they assimilate or build a higher wall is an open question. Trolls have the most difficult time adapting to other metatypes because their bodies are so different. It’s more than just the size and the horns— they have dermal deposits all over their bodies that make knobs, bumps, and other formations. They scrape up furniture and clothing, and make some people think twice about giving a troll a big bear hug. Especially since there are few people who can wrap their arms around a whole troll.




## Chapter 3: Contacts & Allies

A shadowrunner who goes it alone is often one
that winds up in a lonely, solitary grave. Experienced
shadowrunners build a network of people who can
provide the information and goods critical to their
work. Maybe it’s a bartender who knows the people
in their neighborhood, or an arms dealer who can get
the ammo that doesn’t flow through legal channels,
or a Lone Star officer who likes to shoot the breeze
about who just got arrested. These people and more
can be reached out to in times of need.

## Chapter 4: Rules

The rules center around rolling three six sided dice. One of those dice **must** be of a different color this dice is called the "The Effect Dice" this dice will add drama, excitement, and moments of unpredictability in the game. 

### How does it work?

Nearly everything is a TEST or CHECK. 

Result = 3D6 + Ability Modifier + Skill Rank

You compare this result to a Threshold (below)

### Thresholds
A Threshold is the minimum number needed to succeed at a task. Threshold Step is used very often in these rules. A threshold step is used instead of giving the Threshold Target (or TN in other games) to allow the Gamemaster to alter the Targets as they see fit for their game without needing to alter the writing in the rules to maintein balance.

For example if a character needs a `Biotech + Logic (2) test` in Sixfinity Standard rules they need to roll *at least* a 9 on 3D6. If a GM decided they wanted that to be a 10 they do not need to change anything just tell the character they succeeded or failed without having to make any adjustments to the rules. This is the same as using the word Simple but the Step makes it easier to explain to a player. This is inspired by a number of 80's games like Traveller, Gamma World, Shadowrun 1e where the target number on dice could change. This allows for some GM's who want to, to easily swap to a D20 and use 5/10/15/20/25 for their TN's and go looking for Dragons in Dungeons if they want.

If you are assining a test and the only thing that matters is their Effect on the roll feel free to make it a Step 1 test. 

| Difficulty | Step | Threshold Target |
| ---------- | ---- | ---------------- |
| Easy       | 1    | 6                |
| Simple     | 2    | 9                |
| Average    | 3    | 12               |
| Hard       | 4    | 18               |
| Very Hard  | 5-6  | 24               |
| Extreme    | 7-8  | 30               |


> Did I really make Sixfinity Dice Agnostic ... more or less yes as long as you know what you're doing. You could use a D20 (swingy), 3D6, 2d10, 2d12, 4d6, 5d4 even 2D6 or 1d12 if you made sure the curve made sense with the Skill Ratings. 

### Rolling 18
When you roll a nautral 18, you get another D6 to roll and add the number on the dice as Bonus Effect.

#### Glitching

Also called a Botch. 

When you roll a natural 1 on the effect dice; this is called a glitch or a botch. As long as you still beat the Threshold provided you are able to get a success. However, something will happen that did not go according to plan this is ruled by the Gamemaster but some suggestions are things like gun jammed requiring a Minor A ction to clear it. We treat this as a "Yes but..." siutation.

What if you roll a natural 3? In that case you have a Critical Glitch. Critical Glitches can be quite bad it depends on the GM a common rule during combat is that the gun is so fouled up it takes a Major Action or it may be completely out of commission until you can make a Mechanics check to repair it. This is treated as a "No and..." situation. A roll of 3 always fails.


### Effect
Effect is the most important part of the Sixfinity Engine. Effect determines how well things went or not. It is used throughout the rules and makes a lot of mechanics function. Additionally, it makes the Gamemasters life a lot easier as they can evaluate Effect in many cases.

#### Net Effect

Net Effect is calculated after a roll. It will always be the difference in two effect totals.

If it is needed in a Success Test the GM rolls and Effect Dice. You compare your Effect Dice (total if you got more than one) with the Effect Dice of the GM. Subtract the lesser from the greater and the net result is the Net Effect. Minimum 1.

In an opposed test you compare the Effect Dice of both sides. Subtract the lesser dice number from the greater dice(s) number and the net result is the Net Effect which goes to whoever won. Minimum 1.

### Advantage and Disadvantage
If used in text or a GM can use as shorthand.

Advantage: Get a Bonus Effect

Disadvantage: You cannot gain Bonus Effect.


### Success Tests
In a Simple test, you roll `3D6 + Attribute + Skill`, and see if you meet total or beat a Threshold established by the gamemaster. The gamemaster establishes the Threshold based on the Threshold Guidelines and suggestions and guidelines established within the rules. If the the total is equal to or greater than the threshold, the action succeeds; in some occasions, the number of effect (the number on the Effect Dice) comes into play.

Written as `Attribute + Skill (Threshold Step)`

This is a very important thing to understand - these are written as THRESHOLD STEP. This allows the Gamemaster to alter the actual dice Thresholds as they see fit without changing how a test works.

### Opposed Tests

In an Opposed test, another character, object, device, or entity is actively (or passively) resisting your efforts, so you must exceed their effort to succeed. In an Opposed test, two parties roll their dice and compare the number to the totals. The one with the highest total wins. Ties typically go to the aggressor, though this may change if net effect are required to make a given effect. The difference between the higher number of effect and the lower number of effect are the net effect in these tests, and they are often applied to the action in some way— for example, in combat, net effect from the attacker are added to the Damage Value of their attack.

Written as `Attribute + Skill vs. Opposed Attribute + Skill` These are rolled for higher roll. Then calculate Net Effect which will go to the winner.

### Extended Tests

Simple and Opposed tests involve actions that are taken and resolved quickly, generally in the course of a few seconds. Extended tests take longer and are for more complicated activities, like repairing an automobile or building a backdoor into a Matrix host. Extended tests have a modifier and a threshold like Simple tests, but they threshold does not have to be met on a single roll (and often can’t be) as it is a threshold *step*. The player can make multiple rolls of the dice,until they have accumulated enough total (totaling the totals from all their rolls) to meet or beat the threshold. With each roll, a certain amount of time passes. This time is known as the interval, and it is listed as part of each Extended test. 

Written as: Extended `Engineering + Logic (9, 1 hour) test`

### Attribute Only Tests

The gamemaster decides when an attribute-only test is called for and what attributes to apply. Attribute-only tests pair two attributes together to form a modifier, although there may be some situations where only one attribute applies. Here are a few attribute-only pairings built to suit situations where no skill suffices.

**COMPOSURE (CHA + WIL)**


Some situations are tough to deal with, even for hardened runners. When a character is faced with an emotionally overwhelming situation there are only two choices. Stay and fight or turn into a quivering lump of goo. To find out which one happens, make a `Willpower + Charisma` Test. Take note that repeating similar situations over and again eventually eliminates the need to perform this test. Staring down a group of well-armed foes will be scary at first, but after a character does it a few times the fear gives way to instinct.

**JUDGE INTENTIONS (CHA + INT)**


Reading another person is also a matter of instinct. A character can use their instincts to guess at the intentions of another person or to gauge how much they can trust someone. Make an Opposed `Intuition + Charisma` Test against the target’s `Willpower + Charisma`. This is not an exact science. A successful test doesn’t mean the target will never betray you (intentions have been known to change), and deceptive characters can gain another’s confidence easily. This primarily serves as a benchmark or gut instinct about how much you can trust the person you are dealing with.

**LIFTING/CARRYING (BOD + STR)**


The baseline for lifting weight is 30 pounds per point of Strength. Anything more than that requires a `Strength + Body Test`. Each Effect increases the max weight lifted by 30 pounds. Lifting weight above your head, as with a clean & jerk, is more difficult. The baseline for lifting weight above the head is 10 pounds per point Strength. Each Effect on the Lifting Test increases the maximum weight you can lift by 10 pounds. Carrying weight is significantly different than lifting weight. Characters can carry Strength x 20 pounds in gear without effort. Additional weight requires a Lifting Test. Each Effect increases the maximum by 20 pounds. For more details on carrying gear, see Carrying Gear.

**MEMORY (LOG + WIL)**


While there are numerous mnemonic devices designed for remembering information, memory is not a skill. If a character needs to recall information make a `Logic + Willpower` Test.

Glitches can have a devastating effect on memory. A glitch means the character misremembers some portion of the information, such as order of numbers in a passcode. A critical glitch means the character has completely fooled himself into believing and thus remembering something that never actually happened.

**RESIST KNOCKDOWN (STR)**


When you take more damage in a single attack than your Physical Limit x 3 you must avoid being knocked prone. Do this with a `3D6 + STR VS Damage Taken or 10 whichever is higher` success means you stay on your feet, failure you are knocked prone. If you take 30 damage in a single attack you are automatically knocked down regardless of the roll. 

**TOXIN RESISTANCE TEST (BOD + WIL)**


`Body + Willpower + the rating of any protective gear/systems`; each Effect reduces the toxin’s Power by 1 point. If the Power is reduced to zero, the toxic substance takes no effect; otherwise, apply the effect depending on the remaining Power level.

### Edge Points

Edge is a character’s luck, the favor of the gods, that unexplainable factor that allows her to beat the odds. A character’s Edge attribute represents the number of Edge points a character has to spend during gameplay. Edge points can be used for a wide range of benfits, each noted below. Edge points that are spent are temporarily unavailable (see Regaining Edge, below)—luck will only take you so far. Note that a character’s Edge attribute never actually changes, even when Edge points are spent, unless the character permanently burns Edge (see Burning Edge)

Humans can have 7 **maximum** edge (8 with lucky), other metatype the **maximum** is 6 without the Lucky Quality. 

Spent Edge refreshes every game session. Or whenever the GM says it does.

On a long rest you get 1 Edge back.

Burnt Edge is gone. You have to buy more with Experience.

#### Spending Edge 

A character can only spend Edge points on her own actions; she cannot spend it on behalf of others (except when engaged in a “teamwork” test). You can only use Edge once on any test/roll or challenge. If you spent a point of Edge for extra dice and rolled a critical glitch anyway, for example, you cannot use Edge to negate that critical glitch since you have already applied Edge to that test.

Spending Edge can do the following, players choice:

- Blitz!: Spend 1 Edge and get your Edge Rating in Bonus Effect to spend on this test.
- Seize the Initiative: Jump to the top of the initiative order. A character cannot both Blitz and Seize the Initiative in the same combat round.
- Dead Man’s Trigger: When reduced to 0 Physical Health or about to die, you immediately regain half your Physical Health. This can only be used once per Breather or Long Rest (5 minutes / 6 hours).
- Close Call: Either negate the effects of one glitch or turn a critical glitch into a glitch.

#### Burning Edge

In certain drastic situations, even spending Edge may not be enough. A character can choose to burn a point of Edge permanently reducing his Edge attribute by 1 for one of the following effects:

- Crits and Things: Burn 1 Edge to get +10 Bonus Effect.
- Not Dead Yet: When facing death you somehow survive. You still take all the negative effects of what happened such as lost limbs, you are just not dead. You are not dying either, you are stable.

#### Bonus Effect

This comes up in some situations. Bonus effect is just like regular Effect. It is the same as having another D6 with the number of Bonus Effect on the dice, it adds to your total **and** to your overall effect. Bonus Effect are applied to the Net Effect after it is calculated. As a rule no one can get more than two Bonus Effect in a single round unless triggered by a mechanic like spending Edge, or rolling a Nat 18.

It will always come up in combat as you are looking to see who has the tactical advanatage in the fight, that person will get a Bonus Effect to spend for each tactical advanatage they have. For example if your Defense Rating is higher than their Attack Rating. Whoever has the advantage will get a Bonus Effect for every 4 points of Advantage they have.

Oda is attacking an Eye-Fiver. Here we compare the Attack Rating of the Ares Predator VI (8) to the Defense Rating of the Eye-Fiver (4; Body 3, + 1 for leathers) and see that Oda has a difference of **4 or more greater**, giving Oda one Bonus Effect. 

Next, we check out the situation. It’s nighttime in a dimly lit alley because Oda wanted to get them all bunched together and take advantage of the low-light vision on his cybereyes, which the gangers don’t have. This gives a second Bonus Effect to Oda. 

Finally, we look at any other elements that might help either side. None are present, so the process moves on and Oda has 2 Bonus Effect.

> This is how we handle Advanatage in Sixfinity by giving out Bonus Effect. Instead of re-rolls and extra dice.  There is not a concept of "Disadvantage" because the other side having Bonus Effect and you not getting any is a Disadvantage however some things can prevent you from getting Bonus Effect eliminating things like Burning edge for Crits and Things.



### Individual Rule Sections

These sections are referenced in other locations in the book for how something works. This is the central repository for this information instead of scattering it all over the book in Combat, Equipment, etc. 

#### Direct Neural Interface or DNI

A direct neural interface, or DNI, connects your brain to electronic devices. Direct neural interface (along with a sim module) is required for VR use, but DNI is also useful for AR in that you don’t need any additional gear like earbuds or an image link to see or hear augmented reality objects. How do you sign up? You get DNI by wearing trodes, or having an implanted datajack, commlink, or cyberdeck. And if you’re using a sim module along with your DNI, you can get a sort of “super AR mode” where you can also feel, smell, and taste your AR experience.

#### Grenades

When throwing a grenade, choose a location as a target. Use a Throw Weapon Minor Action and make a Throwing Weapons + Agility [Physical] (Threshold 18) Test modified for range and all the usual conditions. Success means the grenade lands right where you wanted. If you don’t meet the Threshold, the grenade scatters. The gamemaster determines scatter by consulting the Scatter Table (Determine Scatter). Hitting the Threshold on the test means no scatter, but it is still possible to hit the target if the scatter roll is low and the thrower got some Effect (see Determine Scatter). This all goes back to the old saying: “Close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades.”

Grenades are small, self-contained explosive or gasdelivery packages. They may come with a built-in timer to detonate after a pre-set amount of time (usually three seconds), a motion-sensor set to detonate on impact, or a wireless link set to detonate upon remote command. The type of detonation device determines the special rules and timing of grenade explosions.

Built-in Timer: This detonation method uses the attacker’s Initiative Score as the determining factor for detonation. The grenade is thrown during the character’s Action Phase and detonates in the next Combat Turn on the Initiative Score in which it was thrown minus 10, regardless of any additional changes to the thrower’s Initiative Score.

Motion Sensor: Grenades using a motion sensor are extremely dangerous. Once armed (about a second after the sensor is activated) the grenade explodes after any sudden stop or change in direction, meaning hitting the wall, floor, or target. This method uses the standard Ranged Attack rules but adds an extra step if it misses the target (no net Effect on the attack roll). After a failed attack roll, the thrower must roll for scatter and the grenade scatters the full amount before exploding immediately. A glitch on the attack roll means the grenade does not detonate on initial impact but instead doubles the scatter distance and explodes. A Critical Glitch means the thrower waited too long, and the throw sets off the grenade. The grenade detonates immediately, affecting the attacker and those around him. (Warned you it was dangerous.)

Wireless Link: This is the safest way to throw a grenade in some aspects, but it also comes with some risk and effort. The thrower (or anyone else who has a mark on the grenade) can detonate it by a wireless link. This requires the attacker to have a direct neural interface to the linked device and use the Change Wireless Device Mode Free Action. This method also reduces scatter. Without a DNI the attacker must use the Change Linked Device Mode Minor Action in their next or any of their subsequent Action Phases to detonate the grenade and scatter is not reduced.

##### Determine Scatter

If the attacker misses their intended landing spot, the gamemaster must determine the projectile’s scatter. The gamemaster determines the direction of the scatter by rolling 2D6 and consulting the Scatter Diagram. The 7 arrow indicates the direction of the launch, so a result of 7 means the projectile continued on past the target, while a result of 12 or 2 means the projectile scatters back in the direction of the attacker. Having determined the direction of the scatter, the gamemaster calculates the distance. The Scatter Table indicates a number of dice rolled based on the projectile, which is reduced by the number of Effect the attacker rolled. This is used to determine the final scatter distance. If the scatter distance is reduced to 0 or less, the projectile hits the target exactly. (Note that additional Effect do not add to Damage Values).

| Roll | Direction from Target |
| ---- | --------------------- |
| 2,12 | 6 oclock, south       |
| 3    | 8 oclock, SW          |
| 4    | 9 oclock, W           |
| 5    | 10 oclock,            |
| 6    | 11 oclock, NW         |
| 7    | 12 oclock, N          |
| 8    | 1 oclock, NE          |
| 9    | 2 oclock              |
| 10   | 3 oclock, E           |
| 11   | 5 oclock, SE          |


**Scatter Table**


| Type                | Scatter              |
| ------------------- | -------------------- |
| Standard Grenade    | (1D6 – Effect) yards |
| Aerodynamic Grenade | (2D6 – Effect) yards |
| Grenade Launcher    | (3D6 – Effect) yards |
| Missile Launcher    | (4D6 – Effect) yards |
| Rocket Launcher     | (5D6 – Effect) yards |

#### Grenade Launchers, Rockets, & Missiles

Occasionally, characters get their hands on military- grade hardware, like grenade launchers, missiles, and rocket launchers. Resolving a launched grenade, rocket, or missile attack is a two-step process. The first step determines where the projectile ends up in relation to the target (see Determine Scatter). The second step resolves the effect of the projectile’s explosion.

When you fire a grenade, rocket, or missile you use a Attack Major Action and roll a Heavy Weapons + Agility [Accuracy] (Threshold 18) Test modified for range and all the usual conditions. Success means the launched weapon hits right where you wanted. If you don’t meet the Threshold, the projectile scatters. The gamemaster determines scatter by consulting the Scatter Table.

#### Blast Effects

Grenades, rockets, and missiles are area-effect weapons, meaning that their blast affects a given area and any targets within it. The farther away the target is from the explosive’s final location—the blast point—the less damage it takes, because distance reduces the effect of an explosive’s blast. Different grenade, rocket, and missile types lose blast effect at different rates. Consult the Grenades/ Rockets/Missiles Table to find the projectile’s Damage Code and Damage Value reduction rate.

#### TOXINS, DRUGS, AND BTLS

The Sixth World is a vicious place; it seems like something is always trying to do you harm. It’s not always a physical weapon, either. Sometimes it’s a fragging molecule or simsense program. Toxins come in a stunning array of forms in Shadowrun, some of them weaponized, some of them recreational. This section will deal with them. It opens with those toxins used primarily as weapons against the characters. Following those come the more recreational pharmaceuticals and their technological cousins. Then we finish up with rules and guidelines for substance abuse and addiction.

##### TOXINS

Knockout drugs. Truth serum. Nerve gas. All of these are examples of toxins, a catch-all term for a substance that’s mostly meant for use as a weapon, as opposed to recreation. Each substance has several attribute ratings.

**Vector**


This shows how the toxin is delivered to the target.

Contact toxins can be solid, liquid, or gaseous. They attack the victim through the skin. These toxins, if in liquid form, can be coated on a weapon. In this case, they can be applied with a successful Melee Attack, whether the attack causes damage or not. A chemical seal offers complete protection from this vector, unless it’s breached. Chemical protection gives a modifier equal to its rating to the target’s Toxin Resistance Test.

Ingestion toxins must be eaten by the victim. They can be solids or liquids. Since they must be eaten, they generally take longer to have an effect. Toxin extractor bioware provides a modifier equal to the rating of the augmentation to resist ingested and other toxins.

Inhalation toxins are applied as an aerosol spray or gas, and they must be breathed in by the target. Gas masks, chemical seals, and active internal air tanks provide immunity to inhalation toxins. Chemical protection gives bonus modifier to the Toxin Resistance Test equal to its rating.

Injection toxins must get into the target’s bloodstream, whether through a dart, hypodermic needle, or a cut. These can also be used to coat an edged melee weapon. They are applied to the target with a successful melee attack that causes damage.

**Speed**


This determines how quickly the victim suffers the toxin’s Effect. These effects are always applied at the end of a Combat Turn.



## Chapter 5: Qualities

### Positive Qualities
These provide bonuses in role playing situations, situational modifiers, and permanent effects. 


#### Ambidextrous

Cost: 4 XP

The character can use and handle objects equally well with both hands. The character does not suffer disadvantage for using an off-hand weapon. When using two weapons at once, however, the character must still get disadvantage on the off hand attack. 

#### Analytical Mind

Cost: 5

Analytical Mind describes the uncanny ability to logically analyze information, deduce solutions to problems, or separate vital information from distractions and noise. It’s useful in cracking cyphers, solving puzzles, figuring out traps, and sifting through data. This quality gives the character a Advantage to any Mental Tests involving pattern recognition, evidence analysis, clue hunting, or solving puzzles. This quality also reduces the time it takes the character to solve a problem by half.

#### Animal Empathy

Cost: 5 XP

A character with Animal Empathy has an intuitive sense for understanding and handling animals of all kinds.

Effect: You gain a Advantage on all Tests made to influence, calm, train, guide, or control animals (this includes riding, driving, or directing them).

#### Aptitude

Cost: 14 XP

This quality is how you become even better than the best in the world. The standard limit for skills is 6. Every so often, there is a character who can exceed limitations and be truly exceptional in a particular skill. With this particular quality, the character can have one skill rated at 7 at character creation, and may eventually build that skill up to rating 7. Characters may only take the Aptitude quality once.

#### Astral Chameleon

Cost: 10 XP

With the Astral Chameleon quality, the character’s astral signature blends into the background of astral space and is difficult to detect. All signatures left by the character last only half as long as other astral signatures. Any individuals assensing astral signatures left behind by a character with this quality receive a –2 modifier for the Assensing Test. Only characters with a Magic rating and capable of leaving astral signatures may have this quality.

#### Bilingual 

Cost: 5 XP

A character with this quality reads, writes, and speaks a second language fluently. They can list a second language as a native tongue (see Language Skills). **This quality can only be acquired at character creation**; selecting it gives the character a second free language skill during Step Five: Purchase Active, Knowledge, and Language Skills.

#### Blandness

Cost: 8 XP

This character blends into a crowd; he’s seldom noticed and easily forgotten. He is unremarkable in every aspect of physical appearance. Anyone attempting to describe the character cannot come up with anything more precise than “average height, average build, average hair, etc.” Increase the {Threshold} tier for anyone to recall specific details about the character by 1. This means a Memory Test with a difficulty of Average ({Threshold} 10) becomes a Hard test ({Threshold} 15).

Individuals attempting to shadow or physically locate a character with the Blandness quality in a populated setting receive a –2 modifier on all tests related to their search. The same penalty applies if they’re asking around about the person based on the individual’s physical appearance. If the character acquires any visible tattoos, scars, or other distinguishing features, the bonuses from the Blandness quality go away until the distinctive features are removed from the character’s appearance.

In certain circumstances and specific situations, the gamemaster may determine that Blandness does not apply. For example, a Troll with the Blandness quality still towers head and shoulders over a crowd of humans and so still stands out, no matter how average they dress. The character only regains his bonus by leaving the situation where he stands out.

#### Catlike

Cost: 7 XP

A character with the Catlike quality is gifted with an uncanny elegance, a stealthy gait, and an almost preternatural ability to move without making a sound.

They also claim they land on their feet when dropped, though they tend not to let people test this. This quality adds a Advantage to Sneaking skill tests.

#### Codeslinger

Cost: 10 XP

You are exceptionally skilled at navigating the Net and executing digital intrusions.

Effect: You gain a Advantage on all Tests involving hacking, intrusion, or similar Net-based actions.

Restriction: This Quality may only be taken once.

#### Double Jointed

Cost: 6 XP

Your joints are unusually flexible, allowing you to bend and contort your body into extreme positions.

Effect: You gain a Advantage on all Sleight of Hand Tests when performing escape artist actions, such as slipping out of cuffs, ropes, or other restraints.

GM Discretion: You may also attempt to squeeze into cramped or narrow spaces where a less limber character could not fit.


#### Exceptional Attribute

Cost: 14 XP

Some individuals push beyond the natural limits of their metatype, embodying rare physical or mental potential.

Effect: Choose one Attribute. Your natural maximum for that Attribute increases by +1 above your species’ normal maximum.

Example: A Human with Exceptional Attribute could raise one Attribute to 7 instead of the usual maximum of 6.

Augmented Maximum: The augmented maximum for that Attribute also increases by +1.

Restriction: This Quality may only be taken once.


#### First Impression

Cost: 11 XP

You have a natural knack for sliding into new places and situations as if you belong there.

Effect: You gain a Advantage on all Social Tests made during your first interaction in a new environment—whether infiltrating a group, meeting contacts in a new city, or joining a fresh team.

Limitation: The bonus only applies during the initial encounter. Subsequent meetings and interactions are unaffected.



#### Focused Concentration

Cost: 4 XP (Maxium 6 Rating)

A magician with the Focused Concentration quality has the discipline to manipulate mana more precisely than otherwise possible. This precision reduces stress to the magician. She is able to sustain one spell form with a force/level equal to her Focused Concentration rating without suffering any penalties. For example, a magician with Focused Concentration rating 3 may sustain a Force 3 Armor spell without taking the negative modifier for sustaining a spell. Sustaining any additional spells incurs the standard –2 modifier per spell sustained to Fatigue checks. This quality may only be taken by magician characters that are able to cast spells.

#### Gearhead

Cost: 11 XP

The Gearhead is who you look for when it’s time to stomp on the gas and move. She’s a natural-born driver or pilot. When she’s at the wheel/stick/controls of a vehicle or drone, she has an intuitive understanding of its limitations and its capabilities and is able to coax whatever machine she’s controlling to perform at its best. During vehicle or chase combat, a Gearhead can increase the Speed of her vehicle or drone by 20 percent or increase the Handling modifier by +1 (player’s choice). She also receives a Advantage when attempting difficult maneuvers or stunts in the vehicle. This bonus lasts for 1D6 minutes.

The player can choose to make this bonus last up to an additional 1D6 minutes if she wants. Doing so pushes the vehicle or drone well beyond its design limits and risks catastrophic damage. For each minute the character pushes the vehicle past its initial bonus period, the vehicle automatically takes one point of stress damage (unresisted)

#### Guts

Cost: 10 XP

When a bug spirit with dripping mandibles comes calling, the character with Guts is the one most likely to stand and fight instead of freaking the hell out. Guts gives a character a Advantage on tests to resist fear and intimidation, including magically induced fear from spells or critter powers.

#### High Pain Tolerance

Cost: 7 XP per rating (max rating 3)

Your Overflow is increased by 1 per rating.

Restriction: Maximum rating is 3.

#### Human Looking

Cost: 5 XP

Some non-humans can pass for human in most day-to-day situations. Their appearance, mannerisms, and presence blend well enough that most people simply assume they are baseline human.

Effect: Human NPCs treat you with a neutral baseline attitude when making Social Tests, unless given a reason to react otherwise.

Complications: You may suffer increased hostility from non-human NPCs who resent humans—or who think you’re “trying too hard” to look like one.

Restriction: Only Elves, Dwarves, and Orcs may take this Quality.

#### Indomitable

Cost: 8 XP Per rating (Max 3)

Bodies and minds have limits, but some people have the will to push right through those boundaries. For each level of Indomitable, a character receives a +1 increase to an Inherent limit of his choice (Mental, Physical, or Social). He can take up to three levels and can apply them in any way he chooses (+3 to one Inherent Limit, for example; or +2 to one Inherent and +1 to another; or +1 to all three).


#### Lucky

Cost: 12 XP

Some individuals have an indomitable spirit that pushes beyond the limits of their metatype.

Effect: Your Edge Attribute maximum increases by +1 above your species’ normal limit.

Example: A Human with Exceptional Edge could raise Edge to 8 instead of the usual maximum of 7.

Advancement: This Quality does not grant an immediate increase to Edge; it only raises the cap. The Experience cost for raising the Attribute must still be paid through normal advancement.

Restriction: This Quality may only be taken once.


#### Magic Resistance

Cost: 6 XP per rating (max rating 4)

You have an innate resistance to magical effects, making it harder for spells to take hold—whether harmful or helpful.

Effect: For every 6 XP spent, you gain a +1 bonus on all Spell Resistance Tests. A magically resistant character cannot choose
to lower his magical resistance; it affects all spells and magical effects, good or bad. A character with Magic Resistance is never a willing subject for spells that require a voluntary subject; such spells automatically fail when used on magic resistant characters.

Limitation: This resistance applies to all spells, even beneficial ones such as Heal.

Scaling: This Quality may be taken multiple times, increasing your modifier by +1 for each purchase (up to the maximum of 4).

#### Natural Athlete

Cost: 7 XP

A character with this quality has an innate combination of physical fitness, spatial awareness, and natural athletic or gymnastic talent. While the character may not be a world-class athlete and may require training to achieve peak performance, he is in prime physical shape for his size and weight class. The Natural Athlete adds a Advantage for Running and Gymnastics skill tests.

#### Natural Immunity

Cost: 4 XP or 10 XP

You have an innate or developed resistance to a specific toxin or disease.

Effect:

4 XP: You are completely immune to one natural disease or toxin.

10 XP: You are completely immune to one synthetic (artificially engineered) disease or toxin.

Limitations:

This Quality does not apply to magically based diseases or toxins (such as lycanthropy).

The chosen disease, drug, or poison must be something your character could reasonably have been exposed to. The player and GM must agree on the specific agent.

Exposure: You may safely ingest or be exposed to one dose every (12 – Body) hours with no ill effects. If more than one dose is taken during that period, you suffer normal damage but your recovery time is halved.

Contagion: Immunity does not make you non-contagious. Characters immune to a disease can still carry and transmit it to others, even without symptoms.


#### Photographic Memory

Cost: 6 XP

A character with Photographic Memory can instantly recall facts, dates, numbers, or anything else he has seen or heard. The character gains a Advantage to all Memory Tests



#### Quick Healer

Cost: 3 XP

A Quick Healer recovers from damage more quickly than other characters. The character receives a Advantage to all Healing Tests made on/for/by him, including magical healing.


#### Resistance to Damage

Cost: 8 XP

A character with resistance chooses a *special* type of damage (not Impact or Ballistic) such as Fire, or Poison and gains resistance to that damage. Suffering half-damage from that source. This can only be taken once. 

#### Vigor

Cost: 9 XP per rating (Max 3)

Each time this is taken you increase your Toughness by 1 up to a Max of 3

#### Will To Live

Cost: 5 XP per rating (max 3)

This character can go into the negatives an additional point per rating up to the maximum of 3 when dying. Normally a character can only go into the negative equal to their Body.

### Negative Qualities



#### Addiction

Bonus: 4 to 25 XP

A character with the Addiction flaw is addicted to alcohol, drugs, or a similar substance with a detrimental effect on the character’s health (note that nicotine, caffeine, and sugar do not count). The value of this flaw depends on how severe the addiction is: Mild, Moderate, Severe, or Burnout. 

Mild (4 XP): the addiction is omnipresent but not blatant or intrusive; it may not even be recognized or acknowledged. At this stage it is easier to seek help, but very few recognize their addiction as something needing help at this stage. Addicts experience cravings at least once a week (if not every few days), but can ignore them if necessary without too much difficulty. The addict suffers a –2 modifier to Willpower and/or Stamina Tests to resist the craving.

Moderate (9 XP): the addiction at this stage is marked and  difficult to overcome. Addicts experience cravings at least once a day (if not more), and they are more difficult to ignore. The addict suffers a –4 modifier to Willpower and/or Stamina Tests to resist the craving.

Severe (20 XP): the addiction is out of control. The addict experiences constant cravings (at least twice a day), suffering a –6 modifier to Willpower and/or Stamina Tests to keep from giving in.

Burnout (25 XP): this is the same as a Severe addiction, except the addict has been in this state for some time and is experiencing the tell-tale signs of habitual use on his body. The character is always under the Exhausted condition. If the character does not kick the habit soon, he will continue to suffer advancing Fatigue at a rate determined by the gamemaster until he dies

#### Allergy

Bonus: Below

| Condition | Value in XP | Description                                                                                                 |
| --------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Uncommon  | 2           | The substance or condition is rare for the local environment. Example Silver,Gold                           |
| Common    | 7           | The substance or condition is common for the local environment. Examples Sunlight, plastic.                 |
| Mild      | 3           | Symptoms are discomforting and distracting.  –2 modifier to all tests made while experiencing the symptoms. |
| Moderate  | 8           | Contact with the allergen produces intense pain. –4 to all tests made while experiencing the symptoms       |
| Severe    | 13          | As Moderate but Vulnerable to weapons that do this damage                                                   |

A character with the Allergy flaw is allergic to a substance or condition. The value of this flaw depends on two factors. 

First, determine whether the substance or condition is Uncommon (2 XP) or Common (7 XP). then determine the severity of the symptoms: Mild (3 XP), Moderate (8 XP), or Severe (13 XP). Add the appropriate point values to find the final value. For example, the value of an Uncommon Moderate Allergy is 10 (2 + 8) points. The Allergy Table above gives descriptions of conditions and severity.

#### Astral Beacon

Bonus: 10 XP

The astral signature of a character with the Astral Beacon quality is like, well, a beacon—highly visible on the astral plane. The signature also lasts twice as long as it would without the Astral Beacon quality and others assensing it receive advantage to their Assensing Test for gathering information about it. Only characters with a Magic rating may take this quality.

#### Bad Luck

Bonus: 12 XP

This character is cursed—his own luck often turns against him. Whenever this character uses Edge, roll 1D6. On a result of 1, the Edge is spent, but it has the exact opposite effect intended. For example, if a character hopes to gain a reroll dice to take the higher option, instead he takes the lower option. If a character spends Edge to go first in an Initiative, he ends up going last. If a character spent Edge to negate a glitch, Bad Luck turns it into a critical glitch.

#### Codeblock

Bonus: 10 XP

The character is hopeless at actions with computers. Anytime they interact with the Net or a computer they get a Disadvantage to their rolls. 

#### Combat paralysis

Bonus: 12 XP

A character with Combat Paralysis freezes in combat situations. On the character’s first Initiative Test in combat, the character
rolls Initiative with disadvantage. On the second and subsequent Initiative Tests, however, the character rolls his normal Initiative. The character also receives a –3 modifier on Surprise Tests.

#### Gremlins

Bonus: 4 XP per rating (max rating 4)

Characters with the Gremlins flaw never seem to get along with technology. Devices malfunction inexplicably in the character’s hands, software constantly crashes whenever he uses it, components become unusually fragile at his touch, and wireless links suffer faltering connections and odd interference.

For every 4 XP gained in this flaw, increase the number of rolled 1s required to get a glitch (normally 3) by 1 whenever the character is attempting to use a moderately sophisticated device (late 20th century technology or later). 

For example, a character with a Gremlins Rating 2 (10 XP) would trigger a glitch if five or more 1s result from a test. The gamemaster may also require the character to make a test for operations that would otherwise succeed automatically, simply to see whether or not a glitch occurs.

When describing the effects of a Gremlin-induced glitch, gamemasters should play up the notion of a particularly weird mechanical or electronic malfunction. For example, if a Gremlin-plagued character glitches while shooting a pistol, the clip might inexplicably fall out of the gun, or the slide might jump off the rails and go flying into the distance. 

Note that Gremlins is a Negative quality—its effects should be hindering to the character (and entertaining to others). Gremlins should not be used as an “offensive ability,” where a character causes his opponent’s high-tech toys to fall apart merely by touching them.

Consider Gremlins to be a curse on the character—if he wants the technology to fail, then it should be more likely not to. this effect only applies to external equipment.

#### Incompetent

Bonus: 5 XP

A character who is Incompetent possesses a total lack of knowledge or ability with a certain Active skill. If this quality is taken, the player must specify an Active skill in which the character is Incompetent. Incompetent may not be applied to Language or Knowledge skills.

The character is treated as having a skill level of “unaware” for that particular skill. In some cases, a Success Test may be required to perform certain tasks that most people take for granted. Characters may not possess that skill, nor may they default on it. Gamemasters are free to reject any choices that would prove irrelevant or exploitative in actual play.

Incompetent may be purchased more than once, choosing a separate skill each time.

#### Loss of Confidence

Bonus: 10 XP

The Loss of Confidence quality means something has caused the character to lose confidence in himself and one of his abilities. Though a skilled hacker, he failed to hack into a Starbucks host, or despite high Agility, he glitched an easy Climbing Test and fell into a dumpster— whatever the reason, he now doubts himself and his abilities. In tests involving the affected skill, the character suffers a –2 modifier. If the character has a specialization with the skill, the character cannot use that specialization while suffering a loss of confidence.

The skill chosen for the character to have a Loss of Confidence must be one that the character prides himself in and has invested in building. Only skills with a rating 4 or higher may suffer the Loss of Confidence quality. Edge may not be used for tests involving this skill when the character is suffering Loss of Confidence.

#### Low Pain Threshold

Bonus: 9 XP

Your Overflow is reduced by 1 (minimum 0).



#### Uncouth

Bonus: 14 XP

Uncouth characters are antisocial or sociopathic and have a difficult time interacting with others. The cost for learning or improving Social skills is twice normal for Uncouth characters (including at character creation), and they may never take Aptitude in a Social skill.

Additionally, Uncouth characters are treated as “unaware” in any Social skills that they do not possess at Rating 1 or higher. The gamemaster may require the character to make Success Tests for social situations that normal people would have no problems with.

#### Uneducated

Bonus: 8 XP

An Uneducated character has grown up far away from the modern world and is thus
ignorant of modern society in general, possessing only a rudimentary knowledge of reading,
writing, and arithmetic. this is quality is fitting for characters who grew up in primitive societies or back-to-the-land anti-technological communes (for example, Amazonian primitives, Luddite collectives). This quality also applies to certain sentient creatures that have developed their own primitive society.

Characters with the Uneducated quality are considered “unaware” in Knowledge skills they do not possess, and they may not default on skill tests for those skills. The gamemaster may also require the character to make Success Tests for ordinary tasks that the typical person takes for granted. Additionally, the Experience cost for learning new skills or improving existing ones in these categories is twice normal (including at character creation), and the character may never take Aptitude in one of these skills.

#### Unsteady Hands

Bonus: 7 XP

A character with Unsteady Hands has mild shakes that affect the dexterity and finesse in his hands. The character suffers a –2 modifier for all Agility-based tests when symptoms manifest themselves. The condition could be physiological (an untreated genetic disorder or damaged nerves, for example), caused by psychological trauma, or even be symptomatic of age. Certain augmentations or medications can mask these symptoms under normal circumstances. Under more stressful situations in the course of the run, there is a chance the Unsteady Hands condition can reappear. The character makes an Agility + Body ({Threshold} 20) Test following a stressful encounter (combat, for example). A successful test means the character does not experience the symptoms of this condition (this time). A failed test causes the difficulties associated with unsteady hands to re-emerge, and they remain with the character for the remainder of the run.

#### Tracked (Layered)

Bonus: 5 or 25 XP

There are four levels of tracking. They have a record of some sort making them easily tracked.

- National: At the 5 XP level, the character has what is called Nationally Tacked. They have done something to get on the National Tracking list. The government of the country tracking you keeps loose tabs on your activities. 
- Criminal Record: At the 10 XP level the character has a Criminal Record. At some point in his life, the character was arrested and served time for a felony-level offense and was branded a criminal for the rest of his life. He is legally required to alert authorities of his travel and whereabouts at all times; failure to do so is a felony and can lead to re-incarceration. He is shunned by law-abiding society.
- Corporate Tracked: At the 15 XP level the character works for, worked for, or has had dealings with one of the majoe mega-corporations. This corporation keeps close tabs on you, your travel, transactions etc. Corporations do not have the adhere to privacy laws and can be quite overbearing in their tracking, it will be difficult to ever hide anything from them.
- Corporate Warrant: At the 25 XP level this character is actively wanted by a Megacorporation. They have few limits, near unlimited resources and never forget anything.

#### Vulnerability

Bonus: 10 XP

This character is Vulnerable to a type of special damage (not impact or ballistic) such as Fire or Cold. 

#### Weak Immune System

Bonus: 5 XP or 10 XP

This character is at Disadvantage on certain tests. For 5 XP they are at disadvantage to Stamina tests versus Disease. For 10 XP they are disadvantage on tests versus Poisons and Toxins as well as other hazards like Radiation. 




## Chapter 6: Skills

> Note Sixfinity does not use Skill Groups

Base skills are the fundamental skills in Sixfinity. Whereas attributes represent an individual’s inherent capacities, skills are abilities an individual learns over time. Each skill represents the training and methods a character has picked up that enable her to use her natural attributes in a certain way. To reflect this connection, each skill is linked to an attribute. A list of skills and their linked attributes appears in the Skills and Linked Attributes Table, below.

Skills are grouped into two broad categories: Active, and Knowledge. Characters begin the game with a set of skills chosen by the player.

During game play, characters can improve or specialize in skills, or learn new ones as they experience new things. 

**Active Skills**


Active skills are the skills characters use to take action, affect something, or somehow make an impact. These skills are the ones that usually matter the most to characters. Firing a gun, negotiating, driving a car , and so on. For a complete description of base Active skills and specializations see below.

**Knowledge Skills**


Knowledge Skills represent what a character knows about certain subjects. Beginning Knowledge skills are based on a character’s Willpower and Logic attributes. Knowledge skills are useful for fleshing out a character by defining her background or areas of interest, and are used in the game most often to represent legwork, show character development, or allow characters to come up with information they might not otherwise have a chance to gain. they can range from fields of knowledge important in the game universe—such as Corporate Finance, Political History, Research, or Magic—to more esoteric, bizarre, or mundane interests such as trash Metal Bands, or Elven Wines.

Knowledge skills fall into four categories: Stree, Academic, Interests, and Professional.

Each category presents an opportunity to shape the experiences of a character far beyond what happens on a run. Knowledge skills do not affect tests the way Active skills do. In certain cases Knowledge skills may provide the background needed to complete an action, but they typically do not provide dice for Active skill tests. You get a number of free Knowledge skill points at character creation. Skill advancement and additional Knowledge skills follow the skill advancement rules (Character Advancement).

Knowledge skills complement your character. They create meaning and history behind the Active skills and abilities you choose. Shadowrun gives you some room to play with Knowledge skills. You’re free to take practically any Knowledge skill your can think up for your character. Knowledge skills are meant to represent a limited set of knowledge the character could have gained in some in-game fashion. For example, a kid growing up in an Evo corporate enclave could have a skill in Corporate Culture. On the other hand, had she tried to take Culture as a Knowledge skill, it would have been way too broad to be a Knowledge skill and her gamemaster would have told her she needs to narrow it down a bit. Check out the Knowledge Skill Examples to get a good idea about how to hit the Knowledge skill sweet spot

**STREET KNOWLEDGE**


Street Knowledge is linked to Intuition. This type of Knowledge skill is about knowing the movers and shakers in an urban area, along with how things get done on the street. You know about the people who live in different neighborhoods, who to ask to get what, and where things are. The information that these skills cover tends to change rapidly, but your instincts help you keep up.

**ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE**


Academic knowledge is linked to Logic. This type of knowledge includes university subjects such as history, science, design, technology, magical theory, and the people and organizations with fingers in those pies. The humanities (cultures, art, philosophy, and so on) are also included in this category.

**PROFESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE**


Professional Knowledge skills deal with subjects related to normal trades, professions, and occupations, things like journalism, engineering, business, and so on. You might find them helpful when doing legwork for a run, especially those in the corporate world. All Professional Knowledge skills are linked to Logic.

**INTERESTS**


Strange as it might sound, you might have some hobbies outside of slinging mana and bullets. Interests are the kind of Knowledge skill that describes what you know because of what you do for fun. There are no guidelines (and no limit) to the sort of interest skills you can have. Interest Knowledge skills are linked to Intuition.

**Languages**


There are few situations where language skills should require a dice roll. Characters with a language skill don’t need to make tests to understand one another in every day situations. The character’s skill level serves as a benchmark for how well they can communicate in a foreign language over time. However, in critical situations where precise translation is important, a gamemaster may elect to require a Language skill test. For more information, see Using Language Skills.

**LINGOS**


Lingos are informal languages formed out of a mother tongue and heavy with slang, jargon, and culturally significant metaphorical language. Lingos arise out of professional and often cultural need. For example, the Cityspeak word ”wiz” came from jargon specific to the magically active. Lingos are specializations of base languages.

| Name       | Meaning                                                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cityspeak  | A Japanese/English pidgin spoken in Seattle                   |
| Creole     | A French/English hybrid spoken in the CAS                     |
| Street     | Localized jive based on a city’s street population            |
| ‘l33tspeak | Decker code talk                                              |
| Milspec    | Military jargon shared between soldiers/mercs                 |
| Corp       | Technical banter shared by corporate office staff and lawyers |
| Orbital    | Jargon shared by off-world colonies                           |

**USING LANGUAGE SKILLS**


A gamemaster may elect to call for a Language Test anytime information needs to be translated hurriedly or in a tense situation. The Language Skill Table suggests thresholds for the test as well as possible modifiers. Failing a Language Test means the parties are unable to understand each other. If a glitch is rolled, some meaningful portion of the information is presumed to be understood but is actually misunderstood. The gamemaster may want to make the Language Test secretly, in order to maintain the illusion that the characters understand what is going on.

**Skill Ratings**

Skill ratings are the numerical values assigned to skills or skill groups, either at character creation or when the skill is learned during game play. They represent how good a character is at a task when using that particular skill. Skill ratings are written as the name of the skill, followed by the rating. For example, Sneaking 3 means the character has the Sneaking Skill at a rating of 3. The skill rating is added to the linked attribute to determine the modifier added to 3D6 when that skill is used. For example, if the character with Sneaking 3 also had an Agility 4, she would add 7 to her rolls on a Sneaking Test.

The skill Rating is a numerical value ranging from 1, representing the most rudimentary skill, to 7 (or 13 with the Aptitude quality) representing the height of sentient achievement. 

The unmodified skill rating assigned at character creation or purchased during game play is considered to be the character’s base skill rating. Some abilities and implants (as noted) may increase this rating, creating a modified skill rating. A modified skill cannot exceed the base skill rating x 1.5. Specializations, spells, and other implants may provide a bonus to a skill, but do not change the base skill rating. These extra modifiers are listed in parentheses after the base skill, as in Sneaking 4 (+2)

| Rating | Definition   |
| ------ | ------------ |
| -      | Unaware      |
| 0      | Untrained    |
| 1      | Beginner     |
| 2      | Novice       |
| 3      | Professional |
| 4      | Veteran      |
| 5      | Expert       |
| 6      | Elite        |
| 7      | Legendary    |

### Specializations

If you devote extra time to a subset of a skill, it’s called a specialization. If your character has the Gymnastics skill but spends a lot of time practicing parkour, you get a character that is good at Gymnastics but especially good at climbing past obstacles.

A specialization adds +2 modifier to any test made for that skill when the specialization comes into play. You write the specialization in parentheses right after the skill, and then add a “(+2)” after the rating to remind you of the bonus. Characters can have multiple specializations within the same skill, but one applies at a time. For example, a character with the Blades skill who specializes in Axes and Parrying would only receive a +2 modifier to tests when parrying with an axe.

New characters may only take one specialization per skill at character creation (Creating a Character), but you can buy more later. If you want a specialization in a skill, you have to have it first (meaning a Rating of at least 1). 

### Defaulting

It is impossible to prepare for every scenario and only slightly harder to have every skill. When you perform an action without actually having the skill for the test, there’s still hope. You can default the skill, making the test using only the attribute to form the modifier. You don’t have any tremendous talent when you default— quite the opposite in fact. Defaulting imposes a –1 modifier in addition to any other modifiers the situation demands. Unless the gamemaster feels that you’re at a complete loss when defaulting, you can use Edge to Push the Limit and better your chances.

Some skills are too technically demanding for you to default. In these cases, you don’t get to even try the test; you just fail. Vehicles or Unarmed Combat, for example, are relatively simple skills that can be attempted without formal training, so you can default if you need to. Mechanics, on the other hand, is too complicated to try without some training (you could say it’s rocket science). Skills that cannot be defaulted are given in italics on the Active Skill List—and it’s also mentioned in the skill description.

### Skill List

#### Knowledge Skill Examples 

Knowledge skills are about what the character knows,
even if you, the player, don’t. Check out the KnowledgeSkill Table for a few guidelines on what a skill reveals.
Keep in mind that general facts, such as the name of
the head of a megacorp and such, is info that can be
quickly found on the Matrix. Knowledge skills are not
about that basic level of detail, but rather information
that not everyone knows or can find so easily.

**USING ESCAPE ARTIST**


In Shadowrun, you might just find yourself caught instead of killed. Escape Artist provides a chance to escape from most forms of confinement, including ropes, handcuffs, and other bindings. To get out of restraints, make an `Escape Artist + Agility [Physical]` Test against a Threshold based on what you’re trying to get out of. If you succeed, you’re free after working on it for one minute (20 Combat Turns), divided by the number of net effect you get on the test. The dice is modified by a variety of factors, such as whether or not you’re being watched (and trying to be subtle) or if you’re carrying a set of lockpicks. These situational modifiers are on the Escape Artist Table. The gamemaster may decide that some restraints are too difficult to escape from without outside help.

**Escape Artist Table**

| **RESTRAINTS**                           | **THRESHOLD**            |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Rope, plastic cuffs                      | 2                        |

| **SITUATION**                            | **MODIFIER**             |
| Character being watched                  | –2                       |
| Character physically restrained          | –(Restrainer’s Strength) |
| Character has picks or cutting implement | +2                       |



##### FREE-FALL (BODY)

This skill covers any jump from height, including leaps from a third-floor window to jumps from a plane at high altitude. If it involves any kind of attempt to slow or control your fall, this covers it, so it includes skydiving with a parachute, flying a wingsuit, or descending on a line, bungee cord, or zipline.


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: None
- Specializations: BASE Jumping, Break-Fall, Bungee, HALO, Low Altitude, Parachute, Static Line, Wingsuit, Zipline

##### GYMNASTICS (AGILITY)

Gymnastics measures your balance, general athleticism, and all-around ability to use your body. For more information on ways Gymnastics may be applied ingame, see Jumping.


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: Athletics
- Specializations: Balance, Climbing, Dance, Leaping, Parkour, Rolling

**USING GYMNASTICS**


**CLIMBING**

The Gymnastics skill is applied to both assisted and unassisted climbing tasks. Assisted climbing is accomplished with specialized gear such as ropes and harnesses. Assisted climbing is easier and safer, but requires more preparation. Unassisted climbing may be done on the fly, because you climb without any gear. Climbing is a Major Action, and the number of effect you get on your `Gymnastics + Strength [Physical]` Test determines how far you can move vertically or laterally during your climb, as noted on the Climbing Table. The more difficult the climb, the more modifiers you get, which is also noted on the Climbing Table.

**Climbing Table**

| **SITUATION**                                            | **Movement Distance R/up**   |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Assisted climbing down (rappelling)                      | 20 yards + 1 yard per effect |
| Assisted climbing upward                                 | 1 yard per effect            |
| Assisted climbing horizontally                           | 1 yard per 2 effect          |
| Assisted climbing upside down (on a ceiling or overhang) | 1 yard per 3 effect          |
| Unassisted climbing upward                               | 1 yard per 2 effect          |
| Unassisted climbing down                                 | 1 yard per effect            |
| **SITUATION**                                            | **MODIFIER**                 |
| Assisted climbing                                        | +2                           |
| **SURFACE IS**                                           | **MODIFIER**                 |
| Easily climbable (chain-link fence)                      | +1                           |
| Broken (tree, loose stone wall)                          | +0                           |
| Flat (brick wall, side of old building)                  | –3                           |
| Sheer (metal wall, seamless stone)                       | –5                           |
| Slippery or wet                                          | –2                           |
| Greased or gel-treated                                   | –4                           |


**RAPPELLING**

Rappelling is a gear-aided descent at near free-fall speed. This technique requires a `Free-Fall + Body [Physical] (3)` Success Test. So long as you have the proper gear and training, you can brake at any point in the descent, slow your speed, and land safely. Rappelling expends a Minor Action, during which you fall at a rate of 20 yards per Combat Turn. Rappelling characters can increase the number of yards descended during that same Combat Turn by 1 for each net effect beyond the threshold on the Free-Fall Test. If you take another Minor Action in the same phase, such as firing a weapon, you get a –2 modifier to both that action and the Free-Fall Test. Stopping requires another Free-Fall Test with the same threshold. On an unsuccessful test, you don’t slow down and may take damage if you hit the ground at speed (Falling Damage).

**CLIMBING FAILURES AND GLITCHES**

A test while climbing or rappelling automatically halts your progress, and you have to make a `Reaction + Strength` Test to hold on. If you fail this second test, you start to fall (about 20 yards per Combat Turn). During your next turn, you may attempt to stop by making a `Reaction + Strength Test` with a –2 modifier. Your gamemaster may allow other climbers to make a `Reaction + Strength` Test to grab you. Characters who are using climbing gear are allowed an additional test if they fall. Have the character who prepared the safety lines make a `Free-Fall + Logic [Mental]` Test against a threshold equal to half the falling character’s Body (round down). The falling character may apply Edge to this test. If successful, the safety gear catches, leaving the character dangling. If it fails, the character falls (see Falling Damage).

**JUMPING**

Jumping is done from a running or standing position. Running leaps get more distance than standing jumps do, if you have enough room to get up to full speed. Make a `Gymnastics + Agility Test`, applying any appropriate modifiers. For every Effect you get on this test, you jump 1 yard on a standing jump or 2 yards for a running leap. No matter how many effect you get, you can’t jump farther than your Agility x 1.5 yards (net effect beyond this mean you did it with style). For a vertical jump, it’s the same test, but you get half a yard of altitude per hit and the maximum you can jump is 1.5 times your height.


##### PALMING (AGILITY)

Palming is sleight-of-hand skill that gives a character the ability to snag, hide, and pass off small objects.


- Default: No
- Skill Group: Stealth
- Specializations: Legerdemain, Pickpocket, Pilfering

##### PERCEPTION (INTUITION)

Perception refers to the ability to spot anomalies in everyday situations, making it one of the key skills a shadowrunner needs. See Using Perception.


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: None
- Specializations: Hearing, Scent, Searching, Taste, Touch, Visual

**USING PERCEPTION**

Perception Tests are for any situation involving basic senses (sight, hearing, smell, touch, or taste) where you’re looking for something that isn’t obvious. Your gamemaster might call for you to make one, or you can call for a Perception Test by taking an Use Skill Major Action to get a handle on what’s going down around you. Making the Threshold on a `Perception + Intuition [Mental]` Test indicates that you’ve noticed something subtle or important (or both)—net effect determine how much detail you get. If someone is deliberately trying to hide from you, they’ll oppose your test with their own skill (Using Stealth Skills). Perception Tests involving vision (which is most of them) use the same Visibility and Light modifiers as attacks do in combat (Environmental Modifiers). Other modifiers are listed on the Perception Test Modifiers table. If a bunch of people are making a Perception Test and looking for the same thing, use a Teamwork Test.

**Perception Test Modifiers table**

| **SITUATION**                                       | **MODIFIER**          |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |

##### RUNNING (STRENGTH)

Running, as you may guess, is about how much ground you can cover quickly. For more information see Using Running.


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: Athletics
- Specializations: Distance, Sprinting, by terrain (Desert, Urban, Wilderness, etc.)

**USING RUNNING**

The Running skill allows you to increase the distance you can cover in a Combat Turn by taking a Dash Action on your turn. You make a `Running + Strength [Physical] Test`. Each effect adds 1 or 2 yards to your distance for that Combat Turn, based on your metatype (see Movement). The gamemaster may apply modifiers for various types of terrain (rocky, slippery, and so on) and other conditions. You can run non-stop for a maximum number of minutes equal to your `(Body + Running) x 10`. Fatigue damage begins to take effect after this point (see Fatigue Damage).

##### SNEAKING (AGILITY)

Need to get where you’re not supposed to be? This skill allows you to remain inconspicuous in various situations. See Using Stealth Skills.


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: Stealth
- Specializations: Location type (Jungle, Urban, Desert, etc.)

##### SURVIVAL (WILLPOWER)

In the desert with nothing more than a tin cup, a poncho, and an iron rod? You’ll need this skill to help you get out alive. Survival is the ability to stay alive in extreme environmental conditions for extended periods of time. The skill governs a character’s ability to perform vital outdoor tasks such as start a fire, build a shelter, scrounge for food, etc. in hostile environments. See Using Survival.


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: Outdoors
- Specializations: Desert, Forest, Jungle, Mountain, Polar, Urban, or other terrain

**USING SURVIVAL**

Surviving the elements is more dangerous in the Sixth World. Environmental decay has reached unparalleled heights. In Great Britain, for example, a perfect storm of toxic disasters and severe flooding devastated the countryside. Those forced to live on city streets fare no better. The homeless are as likely to be attacked by a swarm of devil rats as they are to be beaten by a ganger looking for a bit of fun.

The Survival skill is used for braving all forms of extreme outdoor conditions—this includes urban survival, where the threats are as likely to come from other people as they are from the elements. It covers the ability to find food, water, and temporary shelter in any environment. If you’re exposed to these conditions for 24 hours or more, you’ll need to start making daily `Survival + Willpower [Mental] Tests`. Modifiers and thresholds for Survival Tests are provided on the Survival Test Table. If you fail the test, you don’t find the food or shelter you need and take Stun damage with a Damage Value equal to twice the threshold step. The Stun damage cannot be healed until you get a good night’s sleep without having to make a Survival Test. If your Stun Condition Monitor overflows and you fall unconscious, you cannot make your Survival Tests, so you just keep taking the damage (now Physical from overflow) until you’re either rescued or dead.

**Survival Test Table**

| **WILDERNESS TERRAIN**              | **THRESHOLD** | **STUN DAMAGE ON FAIL** |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------- |
| Mild (forest, plains, urban)        | 6             | 2                       |
| Moderate (foothills, jungle, swamp) | 12            | 4                       |

##### SWIMMING (STRENGTH)

This skill determines the character’s ability to swim in various bodies of water. The skill level affects the distance and speed at which a character can swim. See Using Swimming


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: Athletics
- Specializations: Dash, Long Distance

**USING SWIMMING**

Swimming is a Major Action. A swimming character can move a number of yards in a Combat Turn equal to the average of their Agility and Strength. You can take a Minor Action to dash with a `Swimming + Strength [Physical] Test`, adding 1 yard per effect, or 2 yards per effect if you’re an elf or a troll. Swimming on the surface of water or under it does not affect this rate of speed. As with the Running skill, swimmers suffer from fatigue after an extended time (Fatigue Damage).

**HOLDING YOUR BREATH**

Sixty seconds (twenty Combat Turns) is the base time a character can hold his breath before any tests are needed. A character needing to hold his breath longer can make a `Swimming + Willpower Test` (with the Controlled Hyperventilation specialization coming into play if you have it). Each net hit extends the clock by 15 seconds (5 Combat Turns).

Once the time expires the character must breathe or take 3 of Stun damage at the end of each Combat Turn until they breathe (this damage cannot be resisted). Once all the stun is gone, the character loses consciousness. At this point the character takes 3 physical damage at the end of each Combat Turn until rescued or dead.

**TREADING WATER**

If you’re just trying to keep afloat, you can tread water. You can tread water for a number of minutes equal to your Strength rating. At the end of this time, make a Simple `Swimming + Strength [Physical] (12) Test`. Success means you can keep treading water (or float, if you’re skilled at Swimming) for the same amount of time before another test; failure means you slip and take 3 Stun damage that you can’t resist. If you have a flotation device, double the time between tests. You can keep treading water as long as you can stay conscious.

##### TRACKING (INTUITION)

This skill confers the ability to detect the passage of metahumans and other game through terrain and use those clues to follow that individual. This skill also allows you to identify unmarked trails and common game paths is various environments. See Using Tracking.


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: Outdoors
- Specializations: Desert, Forest, Jungle, Mountain, Polar, Urban, another terrain type

**USING TRACKING**

Tracking a person or critter requires a `Tracking + Intuition [Mental] Test` with a threshold based on the terrain (decided by the gamemaster using the Threshold table). If the target is actively obscuring their trail, tracking is handled as an Opposed Test. The tracker rolls `Tracking + Intuition [Mental]` against the target’s `Sneak + Agility [Physical]`. Any effect on a Tracking Test can be used to gain additional information about the trail, such as the number of people using the trail, type of critters recently using it, and how old the tracks are. In urban tracking, additional effect can be used to identify local crowd movement patterns, relevant cameras, and AR clues that reveal where the target was heading and how long ago it passed by. The gamemaster may choose to apply modifiers for conditions such as weather, age of the tracks, the amount of people who’ve trampled the trail, and so on. Individuals using a tracking dog or other tracking critter may use Animal Handling as a Teamwork Test for their animal’s Tracking Test.

#### Social Active Skills

Dice rarely need to get involved when characters need to solve problems between one another. Dealing with NPCs isn’t always so easy. Social skills give characters the ability to problem-solve without expending bullets or mana. These skills tend to be linked to the Charisma attribute

Social skills are intended to be used to complement good role-playing, not replace it. The Social Test should come either at the end of a well-role-played scene to wrap it up, or in place of a social situation that would be less interesting to actually play through to get through it quickly. The gamemaster can provide modifiers on this test based on how well you make your point, or how much bulldrek you’re able to pile up without flinching.

**Social Modifiers Table**

##### CON (CHARISMA)

Con governs the ability to manipulate or fool an NPC during a social encounter. This skill covers a range of confidence games as well as the principles behind those cons.


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: Acting
- Specializations: Fast Talking, Seduction

##### ETIQUETTE (CHARISMA)

Etiquette represents the level of understanding and awareness of proper social rituals. The skill works as a sort of social version of Sneak, allowing you to move unimpeded through various social situations. Etiquette also serves as a social safety net in case a player botches a social situation in a way a skilled character would not. See Using Etiquette.


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: Influence
- Specializations: By culture or subculture (Corporate, High Society, Media, Mercenary, Street, Yakuza, etc.)

**USING ETIQUETTE**

Etiquette is about blending into the social fabric. Skilled characters can move through a social situation without anyone realizing that they don’t belong. It’s more than knowing the right mores (you could look those up on the Matrix), it’s about trained instinct.

You can use Etiquette to ease suspicions, so that people might trust you more than they would an outsider. Make an `Etiquette + Charisma [Social] Test` against the other person’s `Perception + Charisma [Social] Opposed Test`. If you get you roll higher, they’ll accept you. If you get 3 or more net effect, their attitude toward you will improve, moving up a line on the “NPC’s attitude” section of the Social Modifiers table.

The skill is not meant to replace role-playing, but it can save you from a social blunder that you (the player) make when your character probably wouldn’t have. When this happens, make an Etiquette Test against a threshold equal to the severity of the blunder (set by the gamemaster). A successful test means your character recovers from the misstep.

When making Etiquette tests with a group of NPCs, use the same rules for influencing groups (Using Social Skills).

A glitch on an Etiquette Test is treated the same as a social blunder—the temporary annoyance could give you a –2 modifier on your next social test. Critical glitches result in major social gaffes that have a lasting effect on the relationship your character has with others—the NPC’s stance towards your character could move one step toward Enemy. This is the stuff of which long-time grudges and major feuds are made, the words of disrespect that set street armies into motion.

##### IMPERSONATION (CHARISMA)

Impersonation is the ability to assume the identity of another person, including voice and physical mannerisms. The skill is limited by the physical abilities of the character. A dwarf might be able to impersonate a troll over a commlink, but the illusion shatters when he is face to face with his target.


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: Acting
- Specializations: By metahuman type (Dwarf, Elf, Human, Ork, Troll)

##### INSTRUCTION (CHARISMA)

Instruction governs the ability to teach people. The skill level helps determine how comfortable the instructor is delivering new material as well as how complex of a skill may be taught. See Using Instruction.


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: None
- Specializations: By Active or Knowledge skill category (Combat, Language, Magical, Academic Knowledge, Street Knowledge, etc.)

**USING INSTRUCTION**

From virtual instructors to how-to vids, there are numerous ways to learn skills. There is no substitute, however, for a flesh-and-blood instructor. In order to teach someone a skill, a character must have the skill at Rating 2 or higher. The teacher can only teach up to their own Instruction Rating. Teaching is an `Instruction + Charisma [Social] Test`. Every effect on the Teaching Test reduces the time for the student to improve their skill by a day (Character Advancement).

Instruction is also used to teach spells, complex forms, rituals, and various other techniques. The rules for using Instruction are a bit different in these cases and are explained in the appropriate sections of this book


##### INTIMIDATION (CHARISMA)

Intimidation is about creating the impression that you are more menacing than another person in order to get them to do what you want. The skill may be applied multiple ways, from negotiation to interrogation. Intimidation is an Opposed `Intimidation + Charisma [Social]` Test against the target’s `Charisma + Willpower`, modified by the appropriate entries on the Social Modifiers Table.


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: None
- Specializations: Interrogation, Mental, Physical, Torture

##### LEADERSHIP (CHARISMA)

Leadership is the ability to direct and motivate others. It’s like Con, except rather than using deception you’re using a position of authority. This skill is especially helpful in situations where the will of a teammate is shaken or someone is being asked to do something uncomfortable. The Leadership skill is not meant to replace or make up for poor teamwork. When using Leadership make an opposed test `Charisma + Leadership`. See Using Social Influence Skills, for test modifiers.


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: Influence
- Specializations: Command, Direct, Inspire, Rally

**USING LEADERSHIP**

The Leadership skill is about coaxing, convincing, threatening, or challenging your subordinates, or getting people to accept you as a superior. If you lead people who accept you as their (lone) superior, even temporarily, you can take a Major Action to make a `Leadership + Charisma [Social] Test`. How this helps depends on what you choose to do.

Command: The target resists with a `Leadership + Willpower [Mental] test` (with Social Modifiers). For every net hit you get, the target accepts you as their leader for 1 Combat Turn. This doesn’t work if you’ve failed on this target before.

Direct: Your effect act as a Teamwork Test for one subordinate’s skill or Composure Test that they perform on or before their next Turn.

Inspire: Your effect act as a Teamwork Test for your subordinates’ Surprise Test for the rest of the Combat Turn.

Rally: Your subordinates add 1 to their Initiative Score for every 2 effect you get.

##### NEGOTIATION (CHARISMA)

Negotiation governs a character’s ability to apply their charisma, tactics, and knowledge of situational psychology in order to create a better position when making deals.


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: Influence
- Specializations: Bargaining, Contracts, Diplomacy

##### PERFORMANCE (CHARISMA)

This skill governs the ability to execute a performing art. Performance is to the arts what Artisan is to craft. The performer uses her skill to entertain or even captivate an audience. See Using Performance.


- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: Acting
- Specializations: By performance art (Presentation, Acting, Comedy, specific Musical Instrument, etc.)

**USING PERFORMANCE**

Performance is a Simple Test with a Social limit—the gamemaster can use your effect to gauge the artistry of your performance. If you’re trying distract a target, or sweep them up in your performance, the generic modifiers on the Social Modifiers Table apply, and your target(s) use their `Charisma + Willpower` to oppose your test.

- Default: Yes
- Skill Group: None
- Specializations: Counterfeiting, Credstick Forgery, False ID, Image Doctoring, Paper Forgery

**USING FORGERY**

Talented forgers can simulate anything from a signature to a credstick to the Mona Lisa. The skill is most often used for doctoring hardcopy IDs, signatures, and official paperwork, but it can be used to fabricate anything you can imagine and your skill level can handle. Creating a forgery is a `Forgery + Logic Test`. The limit for this test is either Physical (for forged art, signatures,and other physical objects) or Mental (for credsticks, documents, and other items that are more data than substance). Your modifier is adjusted by appropriate modifiers (see the Build/Repair Table for suggestions), and given a time requirement by the gamemaster (an interval from the Extended Test Difficulties table is fine).

The quality of the forgery is based on the number of hits scored on the test. This number acts as the threshold for attempts to spot the fake. Anyone examining a forgery makes an Opposed Test using a `Perception + Intuition [Mental]` Test or `Forgery + Intuition [Mental]` Test. If they score as many or more hits than the quality of the forgery, the item is exposed as a fake.

Data-based forgeries, like credsticks, documents, and SINs, don’t really hold up well to scrutiny, what with information being so readily available. They can appear almost identical to the original, but any attempt to get it to act like the original (transfer nuyen, pass a SIN check, etc.) reveals the forgery.

- Skill Group: Outdoors
- Specializations: Augmented Reality Markers, Celestial, Compass, Maps, GPS

**USING NAVIGATION**

Since the advent of AR mapping, a walk through the sprawl never requires a test, but getting from A to B can be a lot tougher when the Matrix isn’t pointing the way. Navigation tests are required when you’re traversing unmarked or highly unfamiliar terrain, such as someone new to Seattle attempting to navigate the Ork Underground. It’s a Simple Navigation + Intuition [Mental] Test, with a threshold based on the terrain, taking into account modifiers for environmental factors such as poor visibility, landmarks, existing trails, advice from locals, and so on—your gamemaster will give you a tn

##### SOFTWARE (LOGIC)

Software is the skill used to create and manipulate programming in the Matrix. See Using Software.

- Default: No
- Skill Group: Electronics
- Specializations: Data Bombs or by complex form (Editor, Resonance Spike, Tattletale, etc.)

##### BUILDING & REPAIRING

Building or repairing an object is an Extended Test that the gamemaster may decide requires certain tools or facilities. Modifiers from the Build/Repair Table /should be applied to the test. Characters electing to design new items must have the appropriate Knowledge skills to conceptualize and create schematics. The gamemaster assigns a threshold and interval for the Extended Test using the Task Difficulty Table

**Build and Repair Table**

## Chapter 7: Equipment

You’re only as good as your gear. It’s a common saying, but it’s true, especially on the mean streets of the Sixth World. Having the wrong gear at the right time or the right gear at the wrong time are both potentially fatal flaws. Either way you’re probably going to end up in a world of hurt, or worse.

### Gear Stats

The key functions of any piece of gear in Shadowrun are expressed in its game stats. The exact categories of stats depend on the item’s type. Cost is a universal stat—everything costs money—and all items also have Availability. We’ll cover that and some of the more specialized stats.

#### Availability

Availability expresses how easy it is to find a piece of gear. The higher the number, the more scarce the item is. Availabilities typically range from 1 to 6, but circumstances can push them up to 9.

Note that the top levels of Availability are primarily reserved for alphaware, betaware, and deltaware versions of augmentations.

Availability ratings give a general sense to the gamemaster of whether player characters can find a given item, but they also can be used in mechanics in two ways. First, the Availability rating can be used as a threshold in Matrix Search tests to find someone who carries the item—though the gamemaster should note that just because the players find a seller doesn’t mean that seller will be easily accessible. Second, players may ask a contact to locate an item. 

Generally speaking, contacts can find goods whose Availability is less than (not equal to) their Connection rating. Whether they connect the player characters to the gear is a question of Loyalty and role-playing.

**Availability**

- 1 These items can be found just about anywhere. If you’re in a relatively civilized area, just walk a few blocks, and you’ll find a place that sells this.
- 2 These items are a bit more specialized, but that mainly means you’ll have to seek out a store that focuses on this type of merchandise, rather than finding it in your local Stuffer Shack or whatever.
- 3 These are starting to be boutique items, the type of things aficionados seek out, or things that are made in relatively small batches. They’re not the rarest items, but they’re also not sitting in a ton of stores across the sprawl.
- 4 Now we’re getting into specialty markets. These are things not intended for mass markets, and their specialized function isn’t for everyone. Few people in any given sprawl carry them, and their supplies are limited.
- 5 True specialty items. These may be collector’s items or things deliberately made for a niche audience, but they are not at all easy to find.
- 6 These are quite rare, often hand-crafted items. Small workshops and specialty manufacturers make them, and you’ll never find them at a major retailer. Work hard, and you might track a by-appointment seller who will sell you one.
- 7 These items are not available off-the-rack. They are specially ordered and custom-made.
- 8 Same as 7, but you have to make an appointment to order one, and you may be subjected to a background check based on whatever obscure criteria the manufacturer has decided to assemble.
- 9 The most rare items money can buy—you just have to find the person who will take your cash. Owning one of these marks you as a member of the elite, and selling one of them brings in extra cash due to their scarcity.

#### Legality

Some items are listed with an (I) or (L) as part of their Availability rating. The former refers to items that are illegal for private ownership in most places, which means they are only allowed in the possession of security, megacorporate, or government entities. The latter designation is attached to items that require a license in order to legally possess or transport them. Licenses are bought and attached to SINs (or fake SINs). The legal status of any given item is dependent on the local laws. What’s legal in the UCAS may not be legal in CalFree, or vice versa. The listings here are for the UCAS and Seattle in particular, as the UCAS has several laws (like gun possession) that vary by state.

#### Active Program Slots

This shows how many programs an electronic device can have running at a single time.

#### Attack Rating


Close 0-3 yds, Near 4-50 yds, Medium 51-250 yds, Far 251-500 yds, Extreme 500 yds

#### Ammo

This is the ammo capacity a firearm has, as well as the type of container—(belt) belt, (c) clip, (cy) cylinder, (m) magazine, (ml) missile, or (z) muzzle loaders.

#### Armor Rating
This is the boost to a character’s Toughness.

#### Blast
This is the size of a blast of an explosive.

#### Capacity
Some items can hold modifications and other
adaptations, and they have a Capacity rating to indicate
how much they can hold. Other items take
up this space—those items have a Capacity rating
listed in brackets [].

#### Damage Value (DV)
This is used for weapons and is the base damage
the weapon inflicts if it hits. It may have a letter
indicating its elemental damage, such as (e) for
electricity or (f) for fire. For explosives, this is listed
at different ranges, including ground zero (GZ),
Close, and Near ranges.

#### Device Rating
Used for electronic devices, this is a kind of
all-purpose stat that reflects the devices overall
power and systems integrity.

#### Essence
Used for cyberware and bioware, this shows the
Essence reduction you experience when installing
this item.

#### Modes
These are the firing modes firearms use.

#### Mount
This describes where an accessory is placed

#### Rating
If an item has a range of ratings in which it is available, it is listed in this column or next to the item’s name.

> Why isn't range listed? Because its a dumb concept in a TTRPG. I can hit a target with an AR-15 at almost a mile out. Basically if I can see it, its in range. Thats why. I love Gygax as much as the next guy but a Longbow fired by a professional can hit a target at a 100 yards easily which is also within site.

### Moving Gear

#### Standard Goods

Some general assumptions of item ownership come with the purchase of a Lifestyle. Basic clothing and doss furnishings would be included along with general amenities appropriate to the Lifestyle level. These items only need to be worried about when a character loses their Lifestyle or doss due to unforeseen circumstances, but they are replaced as soon as the runner buys a new Lifestyle.

#### Starting Gear

Runners use the funds they get at character creation to buy their initial gear. This includes arms, armor, tech, vehicles, and everything else that wouldn’t be a normal part of everyday life. These items should have some kind of note on where they are stored, because the runner could lose items if they keep them in their vehicle and it gets stolen, keep them at their base and it gets burned, or keep them on their person and they get pinched

#### Fencing Gear

Let’s make this simple. In order to fence the valuables you come across, you need a contact who’s in the right field (your bartender contact isn’t going to be the most useful helping you unload that cyberdeck prototype you lifted from Mitsuhama). If you have the right contact, you can get back ten percent of the base value on the item, plus one percent for every Effect on an `Influence + Charisma test (Avail)`. If the item is particularly hot or desired (according to the gamemaster’s discretion) the whole selling process could be more adventurous and offer a bigger payday, but that’s up to the individual running the show.

#### Concealing Gear

Sometimes you want to keep your stuff away from prying eyes. There is no active test for hiding gear—you put it in its carrier or holster or whatever and hope the equipment does its job. Spotting gear is based on a Concealability Threshold that is used in Perception tests. Items have a base Threshold based on their general size and shape; some items change this based on their design, whether they are built to be hidden or bulkier than normal and hard to make disappear. All these thresholds assume the item is being hidden by the owner—if you’re holding the item openly in your hand, the Concealability threshold would not apply.

| **SIZE**       | **Threshold THRESHOLD** | **EXAMPLE**             |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Large          | 0                       | Assault Cannon          |
| Bulky          | 6                       | Assault Rifle           |
| Tuckable       | 12                      | SMG                     |
| Pocket Size    | 18                      | Light Pistol            |
| Palm size      | 24                      | Deck of Cards           |
| Slim palm size | 24 + 2 Effect           | Single Card             |
| Palmable       | 24 + 3 Effect           | Lighter                 |
| Small          | 24 + 4 Effect           | 6 sided die             |
| Mini           | 24 + 5 Effect           | Stealth RFID Tag        |
| Fine           | 24 + 6 Effect           | Powder traces           |
| Microscopic    | 24 + 7 Effect           | A flea on your shoulder |

#### Size Cost Adjustments
Most gear is built to be used by humans, or at least human-sized creatures. Elves and orks are close enough to human sizes that they can generally make this gear work for them, but it’s not as easy for dwarfs and trolls. They usually need to shop at special stores or order their gear with certain customizations made to it. To account for this, dwarfs pay a ten percent markup on all the fitted gear they purchase. This applies to items like armor and clothes Size Cost Adjustments Most gear is built to be used by humans, or at least human-sized creatures.

They usually need to shop at special stores or order their gear with certain customizations made to it. To account for this, dwarfs pay a ten percent markup on all the fitted gear they purchase. This applies to items like armor and clothes

**Using Unadapted Gear**

Sometimes a dwarf or a troll has to use someone else’s stuff or make do with what’s handy. Any time a dwarf or troll uses gear that is not adapted for them, they suffer a –2 penalty on all actions involving that gear. This means armor doesn’t close right, guns don’t fit right, commlinks aren’t easy to use, etc

#### Wireless Functionality

Nearly every device is wireless. The wireless revolution started for tracking purposes, though most of the tracking was about observing consumer behavior. The corps also found it useful for inventory tracking and seeing how people used their goods. The only trick was finding a way to make sure consumers had a reason to keep the wireless functionality on at all times. That led to … the wireless bonus!

**Wireless Bonus**

Many items have a bonus applied when they’re kept attached to the Matrix. For the bulk of the population, this is just a little convenient aid in their normal life, but for runners it is often a door- die decision, because leaving your Smartgun XI linked to the Matrix could be the little edge you need, or it could be your doom as you get hacked and the fancy electronics-laden SMG becomes a paperweight. Items with a bonus are listed, and some have it listed for the entire category as well.

**Turning It Off**

Separating yourself and your gear from the Matrix is easy. An `Electronics + Logic (6) Test` as a Minor Action is all it takes in combat. The rest of the time, you can just assume you can figure it out as long as you have the Electronics skill.

**Throwbacks**

These devices are older tech. Whether it’s because they’re incompatible with the current Matrix or devoid of a way to interface with it, they don’t have a way to connect and gain any bonus from the wireless world. They also can’t be hacked in any way shape or form other than the other use of the word, like when a troll swings his axe and hacks your antique rifle in half.

#### Melee Weapon Descriptions

**BLADES**


Sharp edges provide the lethal advantage to everything with a blade. Brute force works, but elegant style is just as effective with objects honed to a razor sharpness.

**Combat axe**

Whether you’re Neal the Firefighter or Neil the Ork Barbarian, you can swing an axe for both utility and violence. The combat axe come with a single or double blade and a hardened spring-loaded thrusting point for breaking glass or providing an unpleasant surprise. In the overmuscled hands of a 2080s street warrior, this weapon can be far deadlier than a firearm.

**Combat Knife**

A simple, elegant, efficient killing device with a chisel point to make light work of armor. It’s also carbon-coated black, so no reflections give away your approach.

**Forearm snap blades**

Don’t like getting implants but still want three razor sharp blades to pop out of your forearm? This is the weapon for you. The blades extend and retract through either a forearm muscle command or a wireless signal. Either way, it takes a Minor Action. 

Wireless bonus: The blades grant an extra Minor Action on the turn when they are extended or retracted.

**Katana**

The iconic two-handed sword of the samurai is standard issue for trid-series shadowrunners. Out on the street, the deadly blade teaches lessons to those who think the trope is solely about looks.

**Knife**

A catchall term for a variety of different deadly fighting blades. The style is up to you, but the stats are all the same.

**Polearm**

Take a long stick, add any of a dozen varieties of blades to the head, and you’ve got a polearm. Designed to keep distance between attacker and defender or strike at a mounted target, they’re not common street weapons. They’re nearly impossible to conceal, even for a troll, but they’re great at keeping problems at a safe distance.

**Survival knife**

Specifically designed with a cutting edge on one side and a serrated sawing edge on the other, the true “survival” piece of this knife is in the handle and its collection of accessories. In the handle you’ll find a GPS monitor, mini-multitool, and micro- lighter. The blade is coated with a photovoltaic skin that blacks out the blade to prevent unwanted reflection; when charged, the skin can be activated to provide two hours of light. Combat stats are the same as the combat knife.

Wireless bonus: The knife displays an ARO of local maps and your GPS position, along with providing basic biomonitor data when in your hand.

**Sword**

A heavy blade on a one-handed grip that comes in a variety of styles. The world’s dominant combat weapon for thousands of years until the firearm came along.

**CLUBS**

**Club**

The stats listed can be used for a range of objects, including an axe handle, baseball bat, crowbar, tire iron, wrench, or even a two-by-four with a couple nails in it. The price listed is for a professionally made, old-style police baton, but it would be relatively easy to find one for free in a pinch.

**Extendable baton**

This telescoping club can be extended with a wrist flick or a wireless signal. In its retracted form, it’s easier to conceal (Concealability threshold 4 when retracted, 2 when extended). Retracting or extending it is a Minor Action. Wireless bonus: You gain a bonus Minor Action on a turn when you retract or extend the baton.

**Sap**

Also known as a blackjack, this is a short, flexible club or a leather-wrapped iron, lead, or sand filled sack for thumping heads. It’s designed to be concealable, often fitting in the palm of the hand (Concealability threshold 4).

**Staff**

Speak softly and carry a big stick. This is that big stick. Available in composite, hardwood, high-carbon steel, and other materials.

**Stun baton**
A riot-control staple and viewed as a symbol of corporate-government oppression, this handy electrical prod is still useful for everyone in the shadows. The stun baton holds ten charges and regains one charge per ten seconds when plugged in. 

Wireless bonus: The stun baton recharges without being plugged in, regaining one charge per half hour of wireless-enabled time.

**Telescoping staff**

A big stick that starts out as a small stick. This metal and composite staff can telescope down to the size of a stun baton or a sword. It can be extended and locked in place by spinning or snapping it out in each direction and giving the handle a twist to lock it. Or it can use a wireless signal to activate the telescoping effect. Extending or retracting it takes a Minor Action.

Wireless bonus: You gain a bonus Minor Action on a turn when you retract or extend the baton.

**OTHER**

**Bike Chain**

Go-gangs love to pull the old equipment off their scrap bikes and smack other people with it. These heavy metal chains are brutal weapons, esespecially when backed by the speed of a motorcycle. You gain a bonus Minor Action on a turn when you use the Trip Minor Action with this weapon.

**Knucks**

Everything from a roll of quarters in the palm (though who has that lying around?) to brass knuckles to Ares Hardliner Gloves, these weapons move a fist from potentially deadly to a probably deadly by augmenting the structure of the hand with metals or composites.

**Monofilament Whip**

Striking fear in the hearts of those who have warily watched its serpentine glow since the 2050s. In the hands of a trained user, this terrifying weapon can cut through armor, flesh, and bone as easy as butter with every millimeter of its two yards of monofilament line. In the wrong hands, or even with a bad twist of a skilled wrist, that line can send you to the street doc looking for a new limb. The whip is stored in the specially designed compartment in the handle with a small weight that detaches when the weapon is activated. Glitches are handled as usual, but a critical glitch always requires the wielder to resist the base damage of the weapon.

Wireless bonus: The whip uses your visuals on the target to make small adjustments in targeting, and the whip adjusts its trajectory. This increases the Attack Rating by 2. Also, the whip’s built-in safety system retracts automatically instead of hitting you on a critical glitch.

#### Projectile Weapon Descriptions

**BOWS**

**Bow**

Everything from the traditional longbow of fiberglass or wood to the modern compound bow. These archaic weapons aren’t common on the streets of 2080. They have the advantage of being hacker-proof as long as you leave off the fancy add-ons. Nocking an arrow takes a Minor Action (Ready Weapon). Bows have a rating that indicates the minimum Strength you need to use the weapon. The weapon’s rating is also used to determine damage (maximum rating is 14). Arrows also have ratings, and they must equal or exceed that of the bow.

**Crossbow**

Modern crossbows are designed with autoloading systems, internal magazines that hold up to four bolts, and come in light, medium, and heavy designs. Light models are single-handed, while medium and heavy designs require two hands.

**Injection Arrow/Bolt**

The injection arrow or bolt causes its base damage while also delivering a payload of one dose of a drug or toxin. A successful hit must deal at least one damage after the Toughness. Injection arrows and bolts come at a base rating of 8. Higher-rating models are available for heavier bows, but lower-rating models aren’t sturdy enough to deliver this heavier projectile.

Wireless bonus: The injection can be delayed until a wireless signal is sent. The injection also doesn’t need any damage; it just needs at least 1 net effect.

**Throwing Knives/Shuriken**

From stars to spikes and everything in between, these stats cover all the muscle-powered, small throwing weapons on the market. Up to (Agility/2) of these weapons can be readied for throwing with a Ready Weapon action.

Wireless bonus: Successful hits leave wireless weapons in targets that can be used to predict movement patterns and offer an estimated location. A successful hit offers anyone wirelessly linked to the throwing weapon and using a smartlink system a +1 bonus for their attacks.




### Firearms

Leadslingers abound on the streets of 2080 (the name remains, even though lead rounds aren’t the norm anymore). For years, the streets managed to snag and use caseless rounds in order to stay clear of the law tracking them, but recent events have led arms manufacturers (a.k.a. the megacorps) to desire a tighter leash on their shadow assets, and cased ammo is becoming the norm once again, with each casing containing a microRFID to identify the weapon and location where it was fired. The glory of watching spent shells spinning through the air is back, and so are the back-alley reloads and scrubbed slugs to keep those of us in the shadows off the radar. Weapons are chambered for cased or caseless, with caseless ammo being marginally harder to track but tougher to find on the streets. 

Wireless bonus: All modern firearms are considered to be wireless-equipped and come with a digital ammunition counter and an ARO that tells you the ammo type loaded. If equipped with DNI, you gain a bonus Minor Action any turn when you eject a clip (for weapons that have them) or change fire modes (on models that have more than one).

#### Firearm Descriptions

**TASERS**

Tasers accept top-mounted accessories.

**Defiance Super Shock**

This heavy-duty taser can fire up to four darts with twenty-yard-long wires. The wired connection to the battery allows for a more powerful shock but limits range. It can also be used point pointblank in Close Combat for the same damage. After a successful hit, if the target does not knock the lines free, the attacker may use a Major Action to inflict the base damage of the weapon again by opening another set of capacitors. 

Wireless bonus: A successful hit informs you of the status of the target’s basic health in terms of Condition Monitors (general statements, rather than exact number of boxes left).

**Yamaha Pulsar I/II**

The Pulsar uses wireless capacitors, meaning that the Pulsar has increased range compared to other wired tasers. As a trade-off, it packs a little less punch than wired models, but it fires faster and delivers repeated hits. The Pulsar I has no melee contacts, but the Pulsar II includes a pair of contacts on the base of the grip to use in melee (treat these as a Close Combat attack as a Club).

Wireless bonus: A successful hit informs you of the status of the target’s basic health and Condition Monitors (general statements, rather than exact number of boxes left).

**HOLD-OUTS**

Hold-outs can’t take accessories or modifications.

**Fichetti Tiffani Needler**

Pretty and deadly are not mutually exclusive. Fichetti gunsmithing combined with Tiffani style makes the Needler the single most popular designer handgun in the world. The base model is matte grey, but its special color-changing coating can be manipulated via wireless signal with an infinite number of patterns and designs. The coating allows your gun to match your shoes, your handbag, or the camo pattern of your fatigues. The Needler only chambers caseless flechette rounds, which are already factored into its damage code.

Wireless bonus: You can change the color of the Fichetti Tiffani Needler with a Minor Action. Applying a camouflage pattern to the Needler increases the concealability threshold by 1 for visual Perception tests.

**Streetline Special**

Designed for cheap 3D nanoprinting, the Streetline Special is made of composite materials, making it harder to detect with MAD scanners (increasing the threshold to detect it by 1).

**Walther Palm Pistol**

Walther keeps the double-barreled derringer with the classic over-under design alive in the latter half of the twenty-first century with the Palm Pistol. Capable of Burst Fire by firing from both barrels at once, the limited ammo supply only offers a six-shot capacity—so tread carefully how often you go with a burst.

**LIGHT PISTOLS**

Light pistols can take top- and barrel-mounted accessories.

**Ares Light Fire Series**

The Light Fire Series is designed for special operators. The 70 is a street standard, while the 75 is not commonly available through regular dealers and standard legal channels. But what runner uses those? The integration of a barrel-mounted silencer in both designs makes the Light Fire series nearly trid-flick silent.

The 75 comes preloaded with smartlink hardware and software, and both come with a laser sight. The silencer for these models increases the threshold for audio Perception tests by 3 for the Light Fire Series when equipped and costs 750¥.

**Beretta T-series**

The preferred sidearm of many security forces around the world, the T-series is classified as a light pistol, even though the 201 design offers automatic fire capability, making it popular in nations that limit heavy and machine pistols. Since the frame is the same, it’s easier to disguise as a 101. The 201 also comes with a detachable shoulder stock, though it is often lost before the gun reaches the street market.

**Colt America L36**

A tribute to Colt’s world-class reputation, the L36 is cheap, easily concealed, and abundant on the streets. In order to be easily transferred between corporate security rookies, the weapon feafeatures an ownership swap feature that has been abused by cops and crooks alike. A perfect throwaway weapon.

Wireless Bonus: The user can alter ownership data with a Minor Action.

**Fichetti Security 600**

Designed as a light sidearm for security forces, the thirty-round magazine allows them to miss a ton and not worry about running out of ammo. This also makes it great for deckers. The Security 600 comes with a detachable folding stock and laser sight.

**Ruger Redhawk**

This rugged revolver is the kid brother of the legendary Super Warhawk. Designed with precision and fun shooting in mind, the Redhawk has a revolutionary single/double firing selector. Classic double action allows a shot with each trigger pull (Semi-Auto Fire), while the single setting lets you play old-west gunslinger and “fan” the hammer (Burst Fire).

Wireless Bonus: You get an extra Minor Action in a turn where you change the action selection.

**Machine Pistols**

Machine pistols can take top- and barrel-mounted accessories.

**Ares Crusader II**

High capacity and comfortable styling make the Ares Crusader II a standout in its class. The Ares brand is synonymous with functionality, and the Crusader II integrates a gas-vent recoil compensation system and comes standard with smartgun systems and software preloaded.

**Ceska Black Scorpion**

Small and lethal, but not designed for beauty. Burst Fire capable from the get-go, it also comes equipped with an integral folding stock.

**Steyr TMP**

A lightweight polymer-frame and full autofire capability are not an ideal design combo, but spraying enough lead to make everyone duck for cover is the goal with the TMP. A top-mounted laser sight comes standard to make users think they’ll be aiming.

**HEAVY PISTOLS**

Heavy pistols can take top- and barrel- mounted accessories.

**Ares Predator VI**

The Predator V rode on the laurels of its name. The Predator VI is genuine innovation built into some classic styling. Built on the framing of the original Predator, the VI comes with the standard smartgun operations but adds Burst Fire capability and a new variable ammunition system that will make it king of the streets and warzones once again, even if it comes with a price tag to match that innovation. The variable ammunition system allows a single specially designed magazine (30¥ per spare) to be loaded with different ammo types. The smartgun is used to select ammo types and cycles them to the chamber in whatever quantity is necessary and available. If there aren’t enough rounds of a particular kind, the ammo counter reads empty and the weapon stops firing.

**Ares Viper Slivergun**

The unique Slivergun hangs out in the Heavy Pistol class, but it’s a creature all its own. The Slivergun fires metal slivers that count as flechette ammunition and are bought as such, but they aren’t interchangeable with any other flechette weapon. The weapon remains capable of Burst Fire and has a silencer integrated into the barrel, and the large ammo capacity makes it a terror on the streets.

**Browning Ultra Power**

Once the Predator’s primary competition as the world’s best heavy pistol, the Ultra Power has ceded its claim to the title since it has not kept pace with the tech advances in the Pred-VI. The Browning is cheaper, though, and offers a built-in top-mounted laser sight.

**Colt Government 2076/Manhunter**

Governments need new weapons contracts for bribe purposes, so having a new standard issue after only ten years seems about par for the course. The years of technomancer and hacker fear since the ’60s have left the electronic firing 2066 in a lot of storage cabinets for fear of hacking. The 2076 takes a jump back to the style of the classic Manhunter (in fact, the model with an integrated smartgun system has that denotation) and comes with an integral laser sight.

**Ruger Super Warhawk**

Boom and glitz! That’s the standard street tag for the Super Warhawk. This revolver is shiny and chrome and makes holes the size of a troll’s fist straight out of the box. Upgrade the ammo or the features and those holes get real precise.

**SUBMACHINE GUNS**

SMGs can take top- and barrel-mounted accessories.

**Colt Cobra TZ Series**

Colt loves variety, and the Cobra TZ series highlights the options they offer with this line. The 100 is the base model with an integral folding stock, the 110 adds a top-mounted laser sight, the 120 features the folding stock, top-mounted laser sight, and a barrel-mounted gas-vent system, making it a hit with security forces all over the world and with trid shows that love all the fancy features.

**FN P93 Praetor**

An unmistakable bullpup design offers a builtin fear response from anyone who sees these guns in the hand of corpsec forces. The Praetor offers an integrated rigid stock, a laser sight, and a flashlight with three settings to benefit low-light, thermographic, or regular vision.

**HK-227**

Heckler & Koch know how to design an SMG, since the 227 has been built off the same frame (the venerable MP5) for over a century. A top choice for corporate and military security forces, the HK–227 offers a retractable stock, integrated smartgun system, and an integral barrel- mounted silencer.

**Ingram Smartgun XI**

Street samurai create legendary reputations that they don’t always deserve, but the Smartgun has maintained its street rep as a grade-A bang bang for decades. Famous as the weapon of choice for many legendary street samurai since the 2050s, the Ingram Smartgun comes tricked out with a gasvent system, a smartgun system, and an integral silencer.

**SCK Model 100**

Shin Chou Kyogo has made the Model 100 the corp-suit equivalent of the Smartgun with the help of the elite Red Samurai. Across the Japanacorps, their security forces are issued the SCK 100. The Model 100 features an internal smartgun system and a folding stock.

**Uzi V**

A new design for a new world. The latest model Uzi is a big market entry for Spinrad Global. The V model features an integral folding stock and builtin top-mounted laser sight.

**Shotguns**

The stats for these shotguns are for normal slug rounds. Shotguns can take top, barrel, and underbarrel accessories.

**Defiance T-250**

A solid street howitzer, this semi-automatic shotgun is available in either a normal-length or short-barreled version. It is gas operated and features a secondary pump action for situations where preventing jams is more important than quickly firing a second shot (clear glitch jams with a Minor Action). The short-barreled version has a Concealability threshold of 3, DV 3, Attack Ratings 8/8/4/—/—.

**Mossberg CMDT**

This assault shotgun provides classic bang for the buck. It can either be loaded with ten-round ammo clips or a big boy twenty-four-round drum. The best features are burst fire mode and a top-mounted laser sight.

**PJSS Model 55**

Rich people own shotguns too. Small production runs, usually purchased by rich European hunters and trap shooters, make this a status symbol made for killing. The Model 55 comes with a rigid stock equipped with an integrated shock pad. Both barrels can be shot at once as a short burst (see Not Enough Rounds).

**Remington Roomsweeper**

Double-barreled and pistol gripped makes this little beast bad news when it slips out of a pocket. If you’re not a fan of flechette shooters, load some Heavy Pistol rounds into a Roomsweeper and she shoots like a really inaccurate hand cannon.

**ASSAULT RIFLES**
Rifles can take top, barrel-, and underbarrel-mounted accessories.

**Remington 900**

A high-powered bolt-action hunting rifle with a classic wooden body. The base model is sold with a top-mounted imaging scope, but it cannot mount underbarrel accessories.

**Ruger 101**

Like futuretech in a hunting-rifle format, this gas-operated favorite sits in the hands of many professional hunters and hobbyists. It features a builtin imaging scope and a rigid stock with shock pad.

**AK-97**

The AK-97 will never go out of style, especially since it still looks like its mid-twentieth-century predecessor. Built for reliability and endurance, it’s not the prettiest girl at the dance, but it can sure shake a tailfeather.

**Ares Alpha**

Made famous in the hands of Ares Firewatch teams, the Alpha quickly became a worldwide success with UCAS and CAS special operators along with a myriad of Desert Wars teams. The integrated underbarrel grenade launcher, smartgun system, and an innovative design for superior handling make it special.

**Colt M23**

Cheap, mass-produced, and infinitely adaptable, the M23 finds its ways to the hands of everyone from gangbangers to pirates to delta-level government operators. The M23 can accept two additional underbarrel accessories for a total of three.

**FN HAR**

Fabrique Nationale is the name to fear when facing private security forces and corporate highthreat- response teams around the world. They made this weapon, which features a laser sight and a gas-vent system.

**Yamaha Raiden**

While Ares made the Alpha, the Japanacorps, through Yamaha, developed the Raiden. Electronic firing and exceptional accuracy are integral to the design. Japanacorp security forces and the Japanese Imperial Marines now swear by the Raiden. It features an integral silencer, smartgun system, and underbarrel shotgun/grenade launcher.

**Ares Desert Strike**

“The Desert Strike for the Desert Wars” is the tagline today. Built to fight in the harshest conditions, the Desert Strike comes equipped with a rigid stock with shock pad and a detachable imaging scope.

**Cavalier Arms Crockett EBR**

Cavalier played a dangerous game by offering a sniper rifle capable of burst fire. The Crockett EBR can stay accurate at long range, but those bursts don’t allow repeated accuracy. The Crockett comes standard with a rigid stock with shock pad and a detachable imaging scope.

**Ranger Arms SM-6**

Ranger Arms knows what the SM line has always been about—silently neutralizing targets. This sniper rifle features a silencer, an imaging scope, a smartgun system, and a rigid stock with shock pad. The SM–6 carries on the line’s ability to quickly get into the action and then get out just as fast. It can fit into a standard briefcase; setting it up or breaking it down takes a Firearms + Logic (6, Major Action) Extended test. The SM-6 has dealt with the line’s fragility issues, and once put together it has no problem operating in any capacity.

**Barret Model 122**

Sometimes you need to shoot an enemy; sometimes you need to shoot an enemy through the side of an APC. The Barret Model 122 excels at tearing through metal and getting to the things it attempts to protect, ripping apart machines and vehicles with horrible tearing sounds that are music to the ears of the shooter. It has a silencer, smartgun system, and folding bipod.


**Machine Guns/Assault Cannons**

Machine guns come in three categories—light, medium, and heavy—that determine their Attack Ratings. All, even the “light” ones, are bulky and unwieldy. A light machine gun is bigger and heavier than most rifles, while medium machine guns and heavy machine guns can only be carried by someone with Strength of 3+ and 5+, respectively, since they are designed as vehicle- mounted weapons. Machine guns can take top, barrel, and underbarrel accessories.

**Ingram Valiant**

The Valiant light machine gun sits in the hands of mercenary units the world over. Basic equipment includes a rigid stock with shock pad, a laser sight, and a barrel-mounted gas-vent system.

**Stoner-Ares M202**

This medium machine gun packs a tremendous punch and is often found in the hands of trolls with no concept of subtlety. It’s a brutally simple weapon, but accessorizing is always an option for those with a taste for more complexity.

**RPK HMG**

This heavy machine gun is used by militaries across eastern Europe and Asia. Usually set up as a vehicle-mounted weapon, it comes standard with a detachable tripod, as the RPK is best fired from a prone, sitting, or kneeling position when not mounted on a vehicle.

**Panther XXL**

Bulky, ugly, deadly, and as destructive as they come. Panther’s XXL model of assault cannon is the thing of nightmares on the street. To make sure every shot counts, it comes with a built-in smartgun system.

**SPECIAL WEAPONS**

Use the Exotic Ranged Weapon skill when firing these weapons.


**Ares S-III Super Squirt**

That name is terrible. Everyone thinks the Super Squirt is some kind of water gun, but it’s basically a glorified paintball marker that fires nonlethal dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) gel packs. The DMSO forces the skin to absorb whichever chemicals the operator wishes to deliver. The attack itself causes no damage, but when the target is hit successfully, the DMSO delivers the substance directly into the target’s bloodstream as a Contact-vector toxin (see Toxins and Drugs). The Super Squirt can accept top- and underbarrel- mounted accessories.

**Parashield DART Series**

Bringing down trolls with a little plastic, steel, and chemical cocktail for decades, Parashield sets the industry standard for dart weapons. The pistol model can accept top-mounted accessories only. The rifle includes a top-mounted imaging scope and can mount top and underbarrel accessories.

Wireless bonus: The dart reports whether or not it has struck home and successfully injected along with the effect based on heart rate and pulse levels, although its medical sensors are not very sophisticated (Device Rating of 1 for the dart).

**Launchers**

The Exotic Weapons skill is used to fire launchers, and they can take top and underbarrel accessories. Grenade launchers fire minigrenades, and missile launchers launch missiles or rockets.

**Ares Antioch II**

The Antioch II is the fanciest tube with a trigger around, complete with an integral smartgun system. A secondary trigger setting allows for wireless activation of launched projectiles. Wireless bonus: You can use the wireless link trigger for your grenades, even if you don’t have DNI.

**ArmTech MGL-6/MGL-12**

Semi-auto grenade launchers in a bullpup pistol and rifle style that can send a whole lot of bad news downrange real fast. 

Wireless bonus: When active the launcher will not detonate any ordnance loaded into the weapon within five yards of the weapon, even if a spoofed command tells it to do otherwise.

**Aztechnology Striker**

Deadly and disposable, the Striker is a great analogy for runners. The launch tube can be reused, which is nice considering recent price increases. Wireless bonus: Connecting this launcher to the local Matrix provides a +1 modifier bonus as long as no other bonus-applying systems are in use.

**Onotari Interceptor**

Saeder-Krupp developed this multipurpose missile launcher for military use. It has two separate barrels that can load two missiles at once, which don’t need to be the same type. Both barrels cannot be fired simultaneously, though this safety feature has been known to be removed, much to the dismay of the target—and the firer, as it turns out. It features an internal smartgun system that controls the fire-safety system. Firing both barrels launches both weapons. Split the attack modifier and resolve each projectile independently. The firer must resist 6P Fire damage when launching both tubes.

Wireless bonus: The safety system cannot be disengaged, but the firer gains the smartlink wireless bonus.



### Firearm Accessesories

Most firearm accessories must be attached to a particular mount—top, barrel, underbarrel. Each mount can only hold one accessory at a time.

**Airburst link**

A smartgun accessory for grenade and rocket launchers uses a rangefinder to air-burst the explosive projectile in close proximity to the target. An airburst link reduces the scatter distance for a launched weapon by two yards per net hit instead of one yard per hit (Blast Attacks and Scatter) when you use the wireless link trigger. The airburst link also prevents the defender from using the Hit the Dirt Action to reduce damage, as the Prone status offers no benefit against the airburst. 

Wireless bonus: An airburst link requires wireless functionality to function at all. Both the grenades and the launcher must have wireless mode turned on for the system to function.

**Bipod**

A two-legged brace extends down from the weapon, allowing it to be fired low to the ground with the user in a prone or sitting position. A bipod can be attached to the underbarrel mount of a weapon and provides a +2 to the Attack Rating when properly deployed. Attaching a bipod takes a Major Action. Folding up or deploying a bipod is a Minor Action.

Wireless bonus: The Attack Rating bonus increases to +3 if used when prone or sitting.

**Concealable holster**

A small holster worn just about anywhere on the body it can’t be seen, attached with a smart adhesive. It increases the Concealability threshold of the weapon inside by 1. Only pistols (including machine pistols) and tasers fit in a concealable holster.

Wireless bonus: Sensors, smart-fabric, and active adhesive allow the holster to alter color and move small amounts in real time, increasing the Concealability threshold by an additional 1.

**Gas-vent system**

Gas-vent recoil compensation systems are barrel-mounted accessories that vent a weapon’s barrel gases at a specific vector to counter muzzle climb. Once installed, a gas-vent cannot be removed. Gas-vent systems remove the Attack Rating penalty for Semi-Automatic fire and reduce it to 2 for Burst Fire.

**Gyro mount**

This heavy harness features an articulated and motorized gyro-stabilized arm. The mount can hold a rifle or machine gun. The system negates the Attack Rating adjustment for Semi-Auto and Burst Fire and provides a +3 Attack Rating for Full-Auto. This system also shifts the Strength requirements for medium and heavy machine guns to 2+ and 4+ respectively. Attaching or removing a weapon from the mount takes a Minor Action. Putting on a gyro-mount harness takes about a minute, while the quick-release allows you to get out of it with a Major Action. 

Wireless bonus: Activating the harness’s quick-release with a wireless signal to exit the harness is a Minor Action.

**Hidden arm slide**

Attached to the forearm and worn under clothing, this slide can fit a Hold-out, Light Pistol, or Taser. With a Minor Action and a specific movement, the slide moves the weapon into your hand. The use of a hidden arm slide provides a Bonus Effect when first used. It also increases the Concealability threshold by 1.

Wireless bonus: You get a bonus Minor Action on any turn when you activate the slide.

**Imaging scope**

The classic top-mounted scope that includes a micro camera and vision magnification, along with a Capacity of 3 for additional vision enhancements. Attachment or removal takes only a Minor Action. The Take Aim Minor Action must be used in order to gain the benefits of an imaging scope, though the modifier bonus from that action is not gained for the first action of use. When you are using an imaging scope, your target cannot gain Bonus Effect by having a higher Defense Rating. Wireless bonus: The scope’s “line of sight” can be shared, allowing you to share what your scope sees with your team (and yourself if you’re using it to look around a corner).

**Laser sight**

This device uses a laser beam to project a visible dot (normal, low-light, or thermographic) on the target. This increases the weapon’s Attack Rating by 1, not cumulative with smartlink modifiers. The laser sight can be mounted as either an underbarrel mount or top mount. Activating or deactivating a laser sight is a Minor Action.

Note that in weapons with a laser sight included as standard equipment, this bonus is already calculated into the Attack Rating.

Wireless bonus: The bonus to the Attack Rating increases to 2. You gain a bonus Minor Action on a turn when you activate or deactivate the laser sight.

**Periscope**

This adjustable viewer attaches to a top mount and allows the user to target a weapon around corcorners, reducing the Cover IV modifier penalty to –1 when using the Take Cover Action. A periscope can be upgraded with any of the vision enhancements noted on. Capacity 3. Wireless bonus: The modifier penalty noted above is reduced to 0.

**Quick-draw holster**

An easy access holster designed to hold pistols and tasers. Use of the Quick-Draw holster provides a bonus Minor Action when the Quick-Draw Action is taken.

**Shock pads**

A shock-absorbing pad situated on the rigid stock of a rifle, shotgun, or heavy weapon. It decreases the Semi-Auto and Burst Fire Attack Rating modifiers by 1.

**Silencer**

A barrel-mounted accessory for reducing the sound and flash of firing a weapon; not compatible with revolvers or shotguns. It increases the threshold on Perception tests by 2 to notice the weapon’s use or locate the weapon’s firer. Attaching or removing a silencer takes a Major Action.

Wireless bonus: The silencer features systems and simple software that alerts you via AR if someone nearby moves quickly in response to the sound of the silenced weapon.

**Smart firing platform**

A robotic tripod equipped with a mechanized pivot that allows for a 180-degree firing arc and a 60-degree inclination. It can mount one smartgun- equipped weapon to the platform. The weapon will be fired by the platform’s onboard pilot (Device Rating 3), using a pre-programmed Targeting Autosoft (Rating 3). It can be upgraded with additional autosofts, usually a Clearsight program. You need to set the parameters of who exactly the platform should and shouldn’t shoot at, which are followed by the platform’s pilot. The platform negates the Attack Rating adjustments for Semi-Auto and Burst Fire and offers a +3 Attack Rating for Full-Auto. It has an Initiative rank of Pilot x 4, 3D6 Initiative Dice, 4 Minor Actions, and 1 Major Action. Wireless bonus: You can fire the mounted weapon remotely using an implanted smartlink using VR, replacing the system’s dice pools with your own.

**Smartgun system**

This is the firearm or a projectile-weapon side of the smartlink system. The system includes a small camera and range finder. It keeps track of ammunition and, through DNI, allows switching between gun modes, ejecting a clip, and firing the gun without pulling the trigger. The camera allows you to fire from cover, suffering no Attack test penalties while affected by the Cover Status. If you’re using a smartlink, the smartgun system increases the gun’s Attack Rating by 2 across all available range categories. The smartgun features are accessed either by universal access port cable to an imaging device (like glasses, goggles, or a datajack for someone with cybereyes) or by a wireless connection working in concert with direct neural interface. Internal smartgun systems add 500 nuyen to the weapon price. An external smartgun system can be attached to the top mount or underbarrel mount with an Engineering + Logic (4, 1 hour) Extended Test. The small camera has a capacity of 1 and can be equipped with vision enhancements.

**Spare clip**

This is an unloaded standard magazine for a specific selected weapon. Wireless bonus: The clip provides a current ammo count even without a smartgun system.

**Speed loader**

The speed loader holds a ring of bullets for reloading a revolver’s cylinder. Speed loaders are specific to the weapon. It lets you fully reload a revolver as a Minor Action.

**Tripod**

The tripod provides a stable base to fire a weapon low to the ground with the user kneeling or sitting. A tripod can be attached to the underbarrel mount. It negates the Attack Rating adjustments for Semi-Auto and Burst Fire and offers a +3 Attack Rating for Full-Auto when properly deployed. Attaching a tripod takes a Major Action. Folding up or deploying the bipod is a Minor Action. Wireless bonus: The player gains a free Minor Action on a turn when they fold up, deploy, or remove the tripod.


### Ammunition

Ammunition is defined by type (regular, gel, APDS, etc.), class of firearm (light pistol, heavy pistol, assault rifle, etc.) and is considered cased unless the caseless option is purchased. Unless indicated otherwise in its description, a gun can fire cased or caseless ammo, but not both. Each class of gun can trade ammo with another of its class. For example, all Heavy Pistols and SMGs can share ammo. An ammunition type’s Attack Rating Modifier and Damage Value Modifier are added to the weapon’s ratings. For example, an Ares Predator VI (DV 3P, Attack Ratings Close 9, Near 9, Medium 7, Far —, Extreme —) loaded with explosive rounds (AR —, DV +1) has a DV of 4P with no change to the Attack Ratings.

**Caseless vs. Cased**

Caseless ammo is rare these days, with the corps wanting to track who’s doing what against them. With no shell casing it’s one less thing to help track down a culprit. They also install a hardened stealth micro-RFID in half of all the cased rounds they produce that activates when fired and alerts local authorities. Most runners have a tech guy who waves his magic wand (tag eraser) over their ammo and fries the tags, but it doesn’t always work, and not everyone owns a tag eraser.

Erasing tags requires a tag eraser. Make an Electronics + Logic (2, 1 minute) for every ten rounds being erased.

**APDS**

Armor-piercing discarding sabot is a mouthful, which is why the APDS acronym is used so frequently. The sabot allows for high muzzle velocities pushing an ultra-hard penetrator designed to punch through armor. APDS is rarely made caseless because the sabot shells are left lying around anyway.

**Explosive**

These slugs carry a shaped-charge explosive. Explosive rounds misfire whenever you roll a critical glitch. When this happens, the attacker must resist damage equal to the Damage Value done by the weapon (and don’t forget the modifier for the explosive rounds). Naturally, the attack misses its
intended target, and the weapon firing the bullets is destroyed.

**Flechette**

The payload of a flechette (fl) round is made up of tiny, tightly packed fin-stabilized metal slivers or metal balls (depending on the weapon). They have some spread, making them more likely to catch a soft spot, but they’re small compared to other ammo, delivering less kinetic energy to the target.

**Gel**

These gel-ball rounds look like flattened blueberries on impact. Generally used for riot control or non-lethal subdual, they’re great for knocking a target on their hoop, though you shouldn’t expect that to work on trolls. Gel rounds inflict Stun damage. A target struck by a gel round must succeed at an immediate Agility (2) or Body (4) test (player’s choice) or gain the Prone status. Burst Fire and Full Auto increase the threshold to avoid being knocked down by 1.

**Stick-n-Shock**

Stick-n-Shock rounds make any regular weapon a taser. They deal Stun damage and apply the Zapped status but don’t carry the punch of the regular round.

**Assault cannon**

Big rounds for assault cannons. They’re the only thing assault cannons can load, and they can’t be modified with other types.

**Injection darts**

Each injection dart carries a single dose of a drug or toxin (purchased separately). Successful delivery of the payload requires at least one net hit on the Attack test versus an unarmored target or two net hits against a target with any form of armor, be it worn or natural. The effect of the dart depends on the drug payload and is an Injection-vector toxin attack

**Taser**

These darts are designed to be loaded into taser weapons.

**Regular**

Classic ball or full metal jacket slugs.


**All Things That Go BOOM!**

Some days, you want to make things blow up real good. Okay, make that most days. Anyway, here are some ways to blow a little select portion of the world to smithereens.

**Grenades**

Grenades are small, self-contained explosive packages. Boom and shrapnel all in one neat and deadly little cluster! Minigrenades are specifically designed for use with grenade launchers, set to arm when they have traveled five yards and explode on impact or with an airburst link. The five-yard safety feature can be disabled with an `Engineering + Logic (4, 5 Minutes) Extended Test`. Minigrenades have the same effects as standard grenades.

The damage from grenades becomes less the farther away from them you are. The DV entry for grenades lists the initial damage for those closest to the grenade, within a yard, called Ground Zero, then two categories of lesser damage for those in Close and Near Range, with the damage limited to a maximum range of the Blast attribute. Use the `Athletics skill + Agility` when throwing grenades, or `Exotic Weapons (Launcher) + Agility` when launching a grenade from a grenade launcher. Follow the rules for Blast Attacks. Grenades and similar explosives can also be rigged with a tripwire to be set up as a basic booby trap. This requires an `Engineering + Logic (8, 1 Major Action) Extended Test`. All grenades have the following wireless feature: You can use the wireless link trigger for your grenades via an ARO on your commlink even if you don’t have direct neural interface.

**Stun grenade**

Often called flash-bangs, these grenades explode to create a bright, loud, shocking blast that stuns and staggers anyone in their range. Along with the damage, those in the Blast of a Stun grenade suffer the Blinded I, Deafened I, and Dazed Status Effect.

**Flash-pak**

This is an electronic box, ten centimeters by ten centimeters on its face and two centimeters thick, containing a set of micro-flashes on each side designed to fire in random strobing sequence to confuse opponents. Anyone in the range of a flash-pak and using standard vision receives the Blinded status (p. 51) indicated in the DV chart on all tests that include vision due to the strobe effect. Using low-light causes the status to shift up one level. Flare compensation drops the status down one level. The flash-pak has ten charges and uses one charge per combat round. Plugged in, it recharges one charge every ten seconds. 

Wireless bonus: The strobe sequence can avoid directing strong flashes at the subscribed character preventing any Status Effect for them. The device can recharge by induction, regaining one charge per hour

**Fragmentation**

The classic grenade, designed to launch deadly shrapnel over a large area.

**High explosive**

These grenades are designed to deliver a powerful blast but over a smaller space.

**Gas**

Any chemical or toxin payload can be chosen (Toxins and Drugs). The cloud lasts for approximately 10 combat rounds, based on the Gas Attack rules.

**Smoke/thermal smoke**

Similar to the gas grenade, a smoke grenade releases a cloud of smoke instead of toxic gas. The cloud obscures vision, inflicting the Blinded I Status for anyone acting through the smoke and Blinded II for anyone trying to act from within the smoke. The cloud lasts for approximately 10 combat rounds based on the Gas Attack rules.

Rockets are launched projectiles with stabilizing fins, a propulsion system, and a warhead. Missiles are rockets that carry internal guidance systems, with sensor packages adding their rating to the attack roll, since they can adjust their trajectory in flight (also reflected in their Attack Rating). Rockets and missiles are set to arm when they have traveled 10 yards from their point of origin and explode on impact or with an airburst link. This safety feature can be disabled with an `Engineering + Logic (4, 5 Minutes) Extended Test`.

As is the case with grenades, damage from rockets and missiles decreases the farther you are from the point of impact. The ranges differ based on the weapon, as listed in the stats for each weapon. All rockets and missiles have the following wireless feature: You can use the wireless link trigger for your rocket or missile, even if you don’t have a direct neural interface.

**Anti-vehicle**

AV rockets/missiles contain a shaped-charge warhead designed to burn or punch its way through a vehicle or barrier. Though the impact causes a blast, it is limited compared to that of a High-Explosive projectile. +2 Attack Rating against vehicles.

**Fragmentation** 

Used principally against people, the warhead discharges high-speed fragments designed to tear soft targets. These rockets/missiles are very effective against unprotected individuals, but not great against barriers, structures, and vehicles.

**High explosive** 

HE rockets/missiles are designed to do heavy
damage to a small area. Their blast pattern is similar
to that of a grenade, but slightly larger.


**Conventional Explosives**

Explosives are primarily used to damage structures, but metahumankind has come up with many ways to have them hurt body structures. You can use the Engineering skill to prepare explosives

A range of explosive compounds, both solid and liquid, are available to the construction industry for all their destructive needs. All explosives are bought as an Explosive Package with a set Rating that encompasses an amalgamation of their power and quantity without defining either. They cannot be combined between rating ranges due to the differences in compounds and quantities. This makes using them simpler

**Plastic**

These highly stable, moldable, and adhesive explosive compounds are military grade. They’re ideal for certain jobs, like breaching walls and are usually color-tinted to indicate the level of current needed to detonate them, from the black of magnetic- field induction to the chalky white of 440- volt industrial explosives. We say usually because some bomb makers like to dye their devices to throw off bomb techs trying to disarm their device.

**Foam**

Plastic explosives with the consistency of shaving cream, stored in an aerosol can. Perfect for spraying into crevices, and detonated the same way as regular plastic explosives.

**Detonator cap**

This detonator is inserted into a mass of explosives and set off either by a programmable timer or radio signal. Setting the timer takes a Major Action. Wireless bonus: You can set the detonator’s timer with a Minor Action. You gain a Minor Action Command DNI-linked device Action to detonate the explosive.

### Clothing and Armor

The streets of 2080 are mean, but so is the air, the rain, the paracritters, and a plethora of other things that can kill you just for walking out your front door. What’s the solution? Armor! Get yours here, and maybe you’ll survive a few days in the sprawl.

**Clothing**

Clothing in 2080 has some serious functionality options: commlinks, music players, and other electronic devices can be woven right in, powered by interwoven batteries or special energy-gathering fabrics. On the other side of the economy, cheap soybased “flats” can be had for ten nuyen a set from vending machines around whatever sprawl you find yourself in. Spend more money, look more chic—simple as that.

#### Clothing Descriptions

**Electrochromic feature**

Electrochromic threads can change color with voltage, letting you alter the color of your clothing or display text, images, or patterns. This is good for fashion, but great for vanishing into a crowd if you need a quick costume change. You can even get armored clothing in electrochromic styles. It takes a Minor Action to change the settings on your electrochromic clothes, but two combat rounds to complete the change.

Wireless bonus: You gain a free Minor Action during any turn when you change your clothes’ settings, and your clothing can display images, text files, or video from your commlink.

**Feedback feature**

This haptic clothing allows for a tactile component to an augmented reality experience.

#### Armor Descriptions

Due to materials advances modern armor can be lightweight, flexible, and concealable. Armor adds to Defense Rating, and multiple items do not stack unless noted.

**Leather jacket/duster**

Synthleather is the norm for street types, and this type of jacket (waist-length to duster) never goes out of style. It even offers a modicum of protection.

**Actioneer business clothes**

This is the fancy armored suit popular among Mr. Johnsons, faces, and fixers looking for a little protection coupled with style. It features a concealable holster in the jacket.

**Armor clothing**

Lightweight ballistic weave makes these garments almost impossible to detect as armor. It doesn’t provide as much protection as real armor, but it comes in just about any style you desire.

**Armor jacket**

Available in all manner of styles, it offers good protection without catching too much attention. But don’t think of wearing one to a social event or government building.

**Armor vest**

A flexible-wrap vest designed to be worn under regular clothing without displaying any bulk.

**Chameleon suit**

A head-to-toe suit with a ruthenium polymer coating supported by a sensor suite, allowing it to scan its surroundings and replicate the images at the proper perspectives. You gain a bonus Edge when performing Stealth tests to hide while wearing an active suit.

Wireless bonus: The suit also raises your Defense Rating by 2 thanks to improved hiding ability.

**Full body armor**

This armor is worn by military and security personnel around the world for heavy-duty jobs. It is styled for intimidation but includes an array of tactical holsters, pouches, and webbing for deadly efficiency. It’s going to draw attention, just so you know. The suit can be modified for environmental adaptation (hot or cold environments) or chemically sealed to completely protect the wearer from toxic environments and attacks. The suit comes with a helmet with a Capacity of 6 for vision or audio enhancements.

**Lined coat**

This cowboy-style duster has been consistently popular on the mean streets of the world’s sprawls for the past fifty years. Besides being protective, the armored trenchcoat provides a bonus Edge against tests to spot items hidden underneath.

**Urban Explorer jumpsuit**

Designed for couriers, athletes, and freerunners, this is the armored version of “flats” but available in a stupid array of styles. Because they’re so hip, these jumpsuits include a built-in music player and biomonitor.


##### ARMOR MODIFICATIONS

Armor can be upgraded with a range of modifications. The Capacity of a piece of armor is listed in the Armor Table. Armor modifications have a Capacity costs equal to their rating; the Capacity cost determines how much you can stuff into a single piece of armor.

**Chemical Protection**

This modification protects the wearer against Contact-vector chemical attacks (Toxins and Drugs, p. 121). The special coating neutralizes the Corrosive status for a number of attacks equal to its rating.

**Chemical Seal**

Available only with full body armor, the chemical seal is an airtight environmental control that takes a Major Action to activate. It prevents the effects of all statuses connected to Contact- and Inhalation- vector chemicals but can only be used for a total of an hour at a time due to the air supply. It also neutralizes the Corrosive status six times before it’s built in chemical protection is worn away and the armor no longer has chemical seal protection. Wireless bonus: Activating the chemical seal is a Minor Action.

**Cold Resistance**

Thermal fibers and heat-retentive materials protect the wearer. The armor cancels the Chilled status a number of times equal to its rating. Once it has resisted the Chilled status a number of times equal to its rating, it is worn away, and the armor no longer has cold resistance.

**Fire Resistance**

Fire-retardant, nonflammable materials protect the wearer. The armor cancels the Burning status a number of times equal to its rating. Past that point, it is worn away, and the armor no longer has fire resistance.

**Electricity Resistance**

Electrical insulation and non-conductive materials protect the wearer. The armor cancels the Zapped status a number of times equal to its rating. Once it has been Zapped a number of times equal to its rating, it is worn away, and the armor no longer has electricity resistance.

#### Helmets & Shields

Helmets come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes and protect your noggin from trauma. Helmets have Capacity that is usable for accessories such as trode nets and vision enhancements.

**Shields**

**Ballistic shield**

The impressive black shield used by SWAT teams and in urban combat. It features a clear plasteel window and a built-in ladder frame along the inside so that it can be used to climb over short obstacles.

**Riot shield**

The clear plasteel cousin of the ballistic shield, this one adds an electricity attack option. Use the Close Combat skill for the attack and attack characteristics of a Stun Baton. The taser shield holds 10 charges; when attached to a power point, it regains one charge per 10 seconds.

Wireless bonus: The riot shield recharges by induction, recharging one charge per hour.

### Cyberdecks

When the corps cracked down on the Matrix, working hard to prevent illicit use of their pretty new system, the cyberdeck re-emerged as the tool for messing with innards of the Matrix. They are powerful devices in the hands of a skilled decker. The newest models look something like medieval bracers, only less bulky. They’re worn on the wrist and can project keyboards (or whatever interface the user prefers) onto the user’s arm, a nearby surface, or just the air around them. Some models have screens; most don’t. They tend to look like a block with a series of ports, though many deckers connect to their deck wirelessly. For more information about them, see Devices. All cyberdecks include hot-sim modules.

Cyberjacks are a fairly invasive piece of gear, implanted deep into the brain, and meant to interface more smoothly with a cyberdeck. While they can act as a simple datajack, they also perform the function of integrating the ASIST interface more directly, thus providing superior speed and response times.

They represent the Data Processing and Firewall attributes

## Chapter 8: Combat

Combat Step By Step

1. Determine Surprise
2. Establish Positions
3. Determine Initiative
4. Take Turns
5. Move to next Round

### Surprise

A band of runners sneaks up on a a group of guards. A hell hound sneaks down an officer hallway, unnoticed by the runners until the hell hound engulfs one of them in flame. In these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other.

The GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the GM compares the Agility  (Sneaking) tests of anyone hiding with the passive Intuition (Perception) [`10 + Intuition`] score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or critter that doesn’t notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.

If you’re surprised, you can’t move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can’t take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren’t.

### Initiative

Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When com⁠bat starts, every participant makes a Initiative Test `3D6 + (Reaction + Intution) + Initiative Die` for personal combat, other types of combat have different Initiative Tests on the table below, to determine their place in the initiative order. The GM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time.

The GM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This is the order (called the initiative order) in which they act during each round. The initiative order remains the same from round to round.

If a tie occurs, the DM decides the order among tied DM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters. The GM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character. Optionally, the GM can have the tied characters and monsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first; or have them go simultaneously.

**Initiative Table**

| Initiative Type | Initiative Test                         |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Personal Combat | (Reaction + Intuition) + Initiative Die |
| Astral Combat   | Inuition x 2 + Initiative Die           |
| Cybercombat     | (Reaction + Intuition) + Initiative Die |


#### Timed Items & Initiative

Unless the item allows a timer to be set, in which case the player can determine when, these items go off at the end of the players turn.

### Movement and Position

In combat, characters and NPC's are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand.

On your turn if you use a Dash you can use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following the rules here.

Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can constitute your entire move. However you're moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.

#### Breaking Up Your Move

You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your another action. For example, if you have a speed of 10 yards, you can move 2 yards, take your action, and then move 8 yards.

#### Difficult Terrain

Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains.

Furniture-strewn offices, rubble filled streets, treacherous staircases—the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.

Every yard of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra yard. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.

Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.

#### Being Prone

Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are prone, a condition described in the appendix.

You can drop prone without using any of your speed. Standing up takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to one third your speed. For example, if your speed is 10 yards, you must spend 3 yards of movement to stand up. You can't stand up if you don't have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.

To move while prone, you must crawl or use magic. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra yard. Crawling 1 yard in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 yards of movement.

#### Moving around Other Creatures

You can move through a nonhostile creature's space. In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature's space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature's space is difficult terrain for you.

Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can't willingly end your move in its space.

If you leave a hostile creature's reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained later in the chapter.


### Action In Combat

The Action economy of Sixfinity is mare structured than the economy in Shadowrun. 

When the action picks up and the game moves into taking turns in initiative order, it’s good to know how much time is passing and what you can do in that time.

When you get to take a turn and describe what your character is doing, your actions are contained in a combat round. A combat round lasts for about three seconds of in-universe time. Everyone, player characters and non-player characters alike, take a single player turn within that round.

Each combat round, you gain an action allotment that you use on your player turn. Actions come in two categories: Minor and Major. The basic action allotment for each character is 1 Minor Action and 1 Major Action per combat round. Players get 1 additional Minor Action for every Initiative Die they have. Players can trade Minor and Major Actions, using a Major Action to perform a Minor Action or using 4 Minor Actions to perform a Major Action (possibly providing an extra attack in a single player turn). Each action has a note next to it indicating when it can be performed; this is either Initiative (I) or Anytime (A). Initiative Actions can only be performed on the character’s player turn during an initiative round, while Anytime Actions can be used at any time. Note, though, that in order to perform an Anytime Action, you must have an Action left. If you spent them all on your turn, you can’t use one later. So sometimes it pays to save an action for later in the round if you act early. Note that actions cannot be carried from one round to another unless that is specifically allowed in a rule.

Along with these actions, enough words can be spoken or conversation can be shared to fill three seconds; if there is any doubt about the amount of words that can be said, time it!

Every **combat round** a character gets:
- 1 Major Action and 1 Minor Actions



#### Minor Actions
These actions usually take only a small amount of focus or a quick and simple thought or movement. A key point among Minor Actions is that they generally do not require a test of any kind. That doesn’t mean in truly dire situations where the pressure is on that the gamemaster can’t ask for a test to be made—it just means that usually, as long as you have the action available, you can perform the task by simply declaring the use of it.

| Minor Actions                 |
| ----------------------------- |
| Activate/Deactivate Focus (I) |
| Attack of Opportunity (A)     |
| Block (A)                     |

| Stand Up (I)                  |
| Take Cover  (I)               |
| Trip (I)                      |

##### Activate (Deactivate) Focus (I)

A character can activate or deactivate a bonded focus that they are carrying on their person with a Minor Action.

##### Attack of Opportunity (A)

When an enemy leaves your threatened area you may make an immediate melee attack on them as long as you have a Minor Action available to you.

##### Block (A)

A character can add their Close Combat skill to their Defense versus Melee Attacks. This lasts until they are attacked or their next turn

##### Change Device Mode (A)

A character may use a Minor Action to activate, deactivate, or switch the mode on any device that they are linked to by a direct neural interface, be it a wired or wireless link. This includes activating or deactivating cyberware, changing a smartgun’s firing settings, switching a commlink to hidden mode, turning a device’s wireless functionality off, and so on

##### Command Drone (I)

A character may issue a command to a drone they control. If multiple drones are controlled through a rigger command console (RCC), the same command can be issued to every drone. If a different command is desired for each drone, it requires multiple Minor Actions.

##### Command Spirit (I)

A character may issue a service command to a single spirit or group of spirits under their control, or dismiss them. The service must be the same. If multiple services are desired, multiple Minor Actions must be used.

##### Dismiss Spirit (A)

A character may dismiss their spirit at any time with a Minor Action.

##### Dodge (A)

A character can add their Athletics skill to their Defense versus Ranged Attacks. This lasts until they are attacked or their next turn.

##### Drop Object (A)

A character may drop an object they are holding in their hand or hands as a single Minor Action. The objects fall to the ground and may suffer damage or ill effects if the gamemaster so chooses, depending on the distance of the fall and the landing spot.

##### Drop Prone (I)

A character may choose to drop themselves to the ground as a Minor Action. They gain the Prone status until they choose to use the Stand Up Action.

##### Move (I)

A character can use this Minor Action for 10 yards of movement. Only one Move Action is allowed per player turn.

##### Multiple Attacks (I)

A character can attack more than one opponent, assuming ammunition, reach, and enemy placement allow it. Split your modifier evenly among all targets rounded down. This action must be used in conjunction with an Attack Major Action.

##### Quick Draw (I)
A character may quick draw a pistol, pistol- sized weapon, or small throwing weapon and immediately attack with this Minor Action. The Attack action must be used in conjunction with this action. They must have the appropriate gear, augmentation, or quality to be allowed this action— if they don’t have something that allows this action, they can’t take it.

##### Reload Smartgun (I)

A character linked to a ready smartgun may use a mental command to eject the weapon’s clip while sliding a new one in with one deft motion, assuming that the new ammo is readily available.

##### Shift Perception (I)

A character capable of Astral Perception may shift perception to or from astral space as a Minor Action

##### Stand Up (I)

Whether they chose to be prone or they got knocked down, a character uses this action to get back to their feet and remove the Prone status

##### Take Aim (I)

A character gains a +1 bonus edge bonus with the use of this action. The action can only be taken once per combat round, but if the bonus is not used, it carries over to the next combat round, allowing it to be combined with actions taken over the course of several combat rounds. If the character takes a player turn without taking the Take Aim or Attack actions, any carryover bonuses from previous rounds are lost. The maximum bonus edge from the use of this action is equal to the character’s Willpower. A character may take aim with a ready firearm, bow, or exotic ranged weapon.

If the character is using vision magnification or a targeting scope, the Take Aim action must be used to line up the shot in order to receive any bonus from the item. In this case, the first action of Take Aim does not provide any additional bonus beyond enabling the function of the modification.

##### Take Cover (I)

The character uses something in their area to provide protection, but they also must operate from the constraints created by the cover. Taking cover gives the player the Cover I, II, III, or IV status

#### Major Actions

These actions take a bit more concentration or time to complete. Several involve a test of some kind, but some simply occur as long as you have the Action available. Just like Minor Actions, if there is no test involved but the gamemaster feels the pressure is on and one should be required, they have final say in the matter.

| Major Actions               |
| --------------------------- |
| Assist (A)                  |
| Astral Projection (I)       |
| Attack (I)                  |
| Banish Spirit (I)           |
| Cast Spell (I)              |
| Cleanse (I)                 |
| Counterspell (I)            |
| Full Defense (I)            |
| Manifest (I)                |
| Observe in Detail (I)       |
| Pick Up/Put Down Object (I) |
| Ready Weapon (I)            |
| Reload Weapon (I)           |
| Rigger Jump In (I)          |
| Sprint (I)                  |
| Summon Spirit (I)           |
| Use Simple Device (I)       |
| Use Skill (I)               |

##### Assist (A)
You make the same test they are making; your Effect becomes Bonus Effect for them to use up to 7 points total from your roll.

##### Astral Projection (I)

A character capable of Astral Projection (full magician or aspected magician) may shift their consciousness to or from the astral plane as a Major Action. The process is complete the moment the action is declared and therefore places them on the astral plane immediately, including for the remainder of the current combat round.

##### Attack (I)

A character may perform one of a variety of forms of attack with this Major Action. See the below for more details.

##### Banish Spirit (I)

Any character may attempt a Banishing on a spirit as a Major Action

##### Cast Spell (I)

A character may cast a spell as a Major Action. For details on how, see Spells

##### Cleanse (I)

Awakened characters use this action to erase traces of their magic activity

##### Counterspell (A)

Perform Counterspell (see Magic)

##### Full Defense (A)

A character can add their Willpower to all Defense tests until their next turn. It persists through attacks until their next turn.

##### Manifest (I)

Characters who are astrally projecting use this action to appear as a ghostly form

##### Observe in Detail (I)

A character may make a detailed observation by taking a Major Action. This action allows a Perception test or Assensing test. This action is intended for determining details that may be obscured due to the pace and rigors of combat. It is assumed that everyone engaged in a combat is aware of the presence of everyone else, barring the use of Stealth or obscuring magic, but not necessarily details of their gear or equipment, and in some particularly hectic or rushed circumstances, the identity of individuals. In the midst of a hectic gunfight/ brawl in the dark, the winner of the brawl, who is now sprinting toward your character, may not be identifiable without an Observe in Detail action. (Deprecated)

##### Pick Up/Put Down Object (I)

A character may pick up an object within reach or put down one that they were holding as a Major Action. This action means care is taken to put the object down or pick it up. If the picked-up object is a weapon, this counts as readying the weapon.

##### Ready Weapon (I)

A character may ready a weapon by using this action. This includes drawing and readying a firearm; pulling a melee weapon from a sheath or pocket; taking out and readying a grenade or throwing knife; or any other kind of weapon preparation. Almost all weapons require this action before they are ready for use, though many times it occurs before combat even starts. Small weapons such as throwing knives and shuriken can be readied in bunches, with a total number equal to the character’s Agility attribute pulled into the character’s off-hand with a single Ready Weapon action.

##### Reload Weapon (I)

Weapons without a smartlink, or weapons where the smartlink is currently disengaged, require a Major Action to reload. Reloading a weapon refills the weapon to its maximum capacity as long as the character has sufficient ammunition to do so.

##### Rigger Jump In (I)

A character with a vehicle control rig (VCR) and rigger-adapted vehicle or drone or a rigger command console (RCC) may jump in to control the vehicle or operate the RCC with a Major Action.

##### Sprint (I)

A character may move at a Sprint with this Major Action. Movement starts at 15 yards and is increased by 1 yard per effect on an `Athletics + Agility Test (1)`. Only one Sprint Action is allowed per player turn, and it cannot be performed in the same turn as a Move action or Avoid Incoming action.

##### Summon Spirit (I)

A character capable of summoning may use a Major Action to summon a spirit to assist them. A spirit that is already summoned is controlled using the Command Spirit Minor Action.

##### Use Simple Device (I)

A character can use any simple device with a Major Action. Simple devices are those that are activated with a simple movement like a thumb trigger, pressing a single key, or tapping a single icon. It takes longer to interact with more complex devices, with required time being up to the gamemaster or listed with the description of specific gear. Remember, a device connected via a DNI-enabled system uses the Minor Action.

##### Use Skill (I)

A character may use an appropriate skill by using a Major Action



### Combat Round

A combat round is approximately 3 seconds long in the game world. During a single combat round, each participant gets an allotment of Actions to use on or around their player turn. The basic Action allotment for each character is 1 Minor Action and 1 Major Action per combat round. Players get 1 additional Minor Action for every Initiative Die they have.

Actions can be traded between Minor and Major, but there are restrictions. A Major Action can be used to perform a Minor Action, simple as that. A character can also trade 4 Minor Actions to perform 1 Major Action.

Characters may never start a player turn with more than 5 Minor Actions. If they would have earned more through any circumstances, that number is reduced to 5.

#### Attacks

Ranged Attack Rolls are rolled as: `3d6 + Firearms + Agility + Misc` vs. Targets Defense.

>Oda is firing a pistol using Firearms 5 + Agility 7 + 1 for a wireless active smartlink (he’s not worried about a hacker in this gang), for a modifier of 13. The Eye-Fiver defends with Reaction 4 + Intuition 3, a defense of 17.
>
> Oda gets 2 Bonus Effect Oda rolls and gets a 24 more than enough to hit the Eye-Fiver. Comparing the Effect Dice for Oda who has a 6 on his Effect Dice and the Eye-Fiver has a 2 on his Effect Dice. Making the Net Effect 4, Oda adds his +2 Effect from his Bonus Effect to have 6 Net Effect.



### Damage

Involved as they are in an illegal and often hazardous line of work, runners get hurt and get hurt often. What kind of damage, how bad an injury is, and how much it affects the character vary greatly depending on the situation.

Damage is calculated based on the weapon, spell, effect in Physical or Stun. You deduct that from your Health. 

> Continuing from Above
> We calculate the incoming damage using the base Damage Value of the Ares Predator VI (3P) and add the net effect (6) to get a modified Damage Value of 8. The Eye-Fiver leader has a Toughness of 1 to soak the Damage, reducing the incoming damage to 8 of Physical Damage. As an NPC the Eye-Fiver only has 10 Health so he has 2 left. 

#### Types of Injury

Damage in Sixfinity is defined as Physical or Stun. Each type of damage is tracked on a separate Condition Monitor.

##### Physical Damage

Physical damage, the most dangerous type, is the kind done by guns, explosions, most melee weapons, and many magic spells. Weapons that inflict Physical damage have the letter “P” following their Damage Value. Physical damage takes a longer time to heal.

##### Stun Damage

Stun damage—bruising, muscle fatigue, and the like— is the kind done by fists, kicks, blunt weapons, stun rounds, shock weapons, concussion grenades, and some magic spells. If something does Stun damage, the letter “S” follows the Damage Value. Stun damage takes a shorter time to heal.

### Healing

We’ve explained to you how to put the hurt on, so now let’s talk about getting the hurt off. Healing in Shadowrun is a mix of in-the-field first aid, miraculous magic, futuristic tech, and heroic speeds of natural recovery. Getting back in the fight is a lot more fun than lying in a hospital bed for weeks or months.

The first thing to cover is the order of operations for healing. Do you need to apply first aid before magic or after? Can you magically heal someone who’s already been treated by a medkit? The answer is simple: The order doesn’t matter, except that Overflow damage heals first. Every character gets multiple chances to get patched up before they’re stuck carrying around their injuries for days. The key here is how soon each needs to be applied. Details are under each description below.

#### First Aid
- Biotech + Logic (5 - Essence)

As implied by the name, this is probably the first aid you should apply because it has the narrowest window. After the end of a combat encounter in which a character was injured, they have 1 minute (20 combat rounds if another fight kicks off) to receive First Aid. To apply First Aid, a character needs the right tools for the job, in this case a first aid kit. Any test made without a kit suffers a -2 modifier, and no Edge can be spent on the test.

Make a `Biotech + Logic test against a threshold equal to 5 – target’s Essence`. If the target is one-hundred-percent natural, the healer actually gets an automatic +1 Effect added to what they roll. This represents the difficulty of repairing someone who has metal parts as well as those with organs not normally found in average people. Effect is used to heal 4 points of Stun Damage (**not including drain**) per effect or 4 points of Physical Damage or 2 points of Overflow per effect. Drain cannot be healed with First Aid. A character can receive First Aid only once for any single set of injuries.

#### Medkit
- Biotech + Logic (5 - Essence)

Medkits are more detailed. The patient must be connected to medkit monitors and diagnosed, after which they receive injections and IVs. After the end of a combat encounter in which a character is injured, they have one hour to be connected to a medkit or get medical attention from a trained professional with a medkit. If they wait beyond this period, a medkit will not help them. It takes one minute to hook up the patient, get the medkit to spit out a diagnosis, and begin treatment. The healing process takes one minute per 4 points healed (so, if the process is interrupted, you know how much they were patched up). Each time a medkit is used, it consumes one batch of supplies. Treatment cannot be attempted if no medkit supplies remain.

Make a `Biotech/Medkit Rating + Logic test against a threshold of 5 – target’s Essence`. If the target is one-hundred-percent natural, the healer gets an automatic +1 Effect added to their roll. Like First Aid, this fixes biological material, not machinery. Effect is used to heal 4 points of Stun, Physical, or Overflow Damage per Effect, but not damage from drain.

There is a limit to receiving a medkit treatment. A character can only benefit from a medkit once for any single set of injuries.

#### Magic
- Sorcery + Magic (using Healing or similar spell)

The wonders of magic are many and great. Healing spells are some of the most commonly studied magics for those working on the streets. Some use their skills to earn a little extra cash patching up gangers; others serve on a runner team, keeping their partners fighting when the bullets start finding their targets. Those with hearts of gold work as regular street healers to give the denizens of the barrens a chance at a healthy life.

The good news about magical healing is it works at the speed of a spell—once the spell is cast, the effect takes hold.

Healing magic can mend both Physical and Stun injuries, but not those caused by Drain. The leftover taint of wearisome mana prevents the healing magics from connecting to that damaged tissue to heal it. As with medkits, net effect can be used to heal 4 points of Stun, Physical, or Overflow Damage per Effect. For more information on casting healing spells, see Magic.

A character can be healed by Magic only once for any single set of injuries.

#### Natural Recovery/Medical Assistance (Varies by damage type)

After all other options have been used, if injury remains, it’s all about rest and possibly some help from a trained medical professional (or just your team medic). Rest is simply defined as not engaging in any strenuous physical or mental activity—essentially, anything that involves a dice roll would break your rest. Medical attention offers a bonus to the recovery roll. If any person trained in Biotech is watching over the character for at least half of their rest period, the wounded individual gains a +2 Effect to the healing tests defined below.

To heal Physical Damage, roll `Body + Body (1)` once per day. Each Effect heals 4 points of Physical Damage after that day of rest.

To heal Stun Damage, roll `Body + Willpower (1)` once per hour. Each hit heals 4 points of Stun Damage after that hour of rest. A full 8 hour (Long Reat) rest will recover all lost Stun Health.

#### Overflow & Dying

Sometimes a hit brings you closer to death than you ever really want to be, and you’ve got some Damage Overflow to recover. These points are healed just like Physical Damage and need to be healed before the character can return to the land of the conscious. Note that if a character receives (Body x 2) points of Overflow damage, they are dead and gone, beyond the reach of any kind of healing.

### Status List
The different statuses used in Shadowrun, Sixth World are described below.


#### Blinded I, II, III

Whether it’s flashing lights, some specialized chemical, or the pure force of magic, there are plenty of ways to make it impossible for shadowrunners to see. For the first two levels of this status, characters take a –3 penalty per level to all tests involving visibility. At the third level, characters automatically fail any tests involving visibility.

#### Burning #

The Burning status is the result of being hit with a flame-based attack. Once the initial blow has done its damage, you have to deal with the continuing heat and flames, and the parts of yourself that may be on fire. **Toughness has no effect on this damage.**

The status should be noted with a number that indicates the amount of Physical damage the character must resist each round while the status exists. There are multiple ways to remove this status. You can spend a Major Action and roll an `Agility + Reaction (2) test`; success means the fire is out and the status is removed. You can also jump into water to remove the status without a roll.

If you gain the Wet and/or Chilled statuses, the Burning status is canceled. Similarly, gaining the Burning status cancels the Wet or Chilled status.

#### Charmed
- A charmed creature can’t attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.
- The charmer has +3 on any test to interact socially with the creature.

#### Chilled

When you are truly, damagingly cold, it seeps into your bones and won’t let go, and you can’t move as smoothly and nimbly as you would like. When you are Chilled, you get –4 to your Initiative Score and –1 to all tests. This status cancels and is canceled by the Burning status.

#### Confused #

Colors, patterns, and weird ideas swirl around your head, keeping you from being able to focus, which makes your actions uncoordinated and awkward. The number after the status acts as a penalty on any test you take.

#### Corrosive #

Acids, bases, and other caustics eat into your flesh and don’t stop. The ongoing damage from these chemicals is noted with the Corrosive status, which comes with a number after it to denote how much damage the ongoing effect inflicts. **Toughness has no effect on this damage.**

This status can be removed with certain gear (like baking soda for acids!) and equipment. The Wet status does not necessarily remove it, as some chemicals continue burning the skin even after contact with water. The gamemaster can determine when enough water has been applied to remove the chemical in question.

#### Cover I, II, III, IV

Whether you hide behind a wall, a dumpster, or a body, Cover is protection from hostile fire. It comes at four levels, indicating how much of a character’s body is protected (one-quarter, onehalf, three quarters, or all). A character in Cover gets a +2 bonus per Cover level to their Defense Rating. Attacking from Cover requires an extra Minor Action in order to get clear enough to take a shot, imposes a –2 penalty to your attack at Cover IV, and you cannot gain Bonus Effect while attacking from Cover (you can gain it from defending).

#### Dazed

One too many thumps to the head, or maybe the solar plexus, leaves the character woozy and unable to act with their normal alacrity. The character reduces their Initiative Score by –4, and they cannot gain or spend Edge (but they can burn Edge) as long as they have this Status.

#### Deafened I, II, III

Whether you heard a sudden, hugely loud clap, or someone stuffed your ears full of cotton-like mana, sound waves are not getting through so that your brain can tell you what they mean. For the first two levels of this status, characters take a –3 penalty per level to all tests involving hearing. At the third level, characters automatically fail any tests involving hearing.

#### Fatigued I, II, III

At its top level, this status is that dreamlike weariness, where your legs are lead and just will. Not. Move. Characters with this status take a –2 penalty per level to all tests. Characters move at 5 yards per turn instead of 10 for walking, and 10 instead of 15 for sprinting.

#### Frightened

Something has hit your lizard brain, and rational thought flees. All you have left is fear. Characters take a –4 penalty to any tests directed to or defending against the source of the effect. They also cannot move toward the source of their fear. 

#### Hazed

Something has messed up your connection to the astral world, leaving that realm out of your reach. Or worse, if you were already astral, you’re stuck there. A character with this status is unable to move between the astral plane and the physical world. They cannot astrally project or manifest. They may still perceive astrally.

#### Hobbled

Any movement on foot, whether by the Move, Sprint, or Avoid Incoming action, is halved (round up). Said another way it cost twice movement to move.

#### Immobilized

Just what it sounds like! Characters with this status cannot move, though they can take any actions that will function with their feet stuck to the ground. Their Attack Rating is reduced by 3, and they take a –3 penalty on all attacks. They cannot use Reaction on their Defense tests.

#### Incapacitated
- An incapacitated creature can’t take actions or reactions.

#### Invisible #

The go-to status for sneak thieves. Characters are less visible to living and sentient beings. The number after the status indicates the threshold step people must hit on a Perception test to notice the character with this status. Cameras and other inorganic methods of visibility detection can see someone with this status as normal.

#### Invisible (Improved) #

The same as Invisibility, but it also affects camera and other technological ways of seeing.

#### Nauseated

Your stomach heaves, your head spins, and you have trouble thinking about anything other than not throwing up. Characters must pass a `Body + Willpower (2)` test at the start of a combat round. If they fail, they cannot take an action that round. If they succeed, they can act, but they lose a Minor Action.

#### Panicked

The drek has hit the fan, and it has splattered everywhere, and you have lost the ability to act in any sort of a coherent fashion. Characters with this status cannot act except to avoid the condition that is causing the Panicked effect.

#### Petrified

There is a good reason why you don’t want to be in the wrong end of a basilisk stare, and this is it. The character is essentially turned into solid material. They cannot take any actions, and they get a +10 Armor Rating. This cancels any other damaging statuses the character may have been experiencing.

#### Poisoned #

Something wrong has gotten into the character’s body, and it’s going to mess them up until it works its way through. This status has a damage code after it, with a number and an indication for either Physical or Stun damage. At the end of each combat round when this status exists, the character must take the damage, Toughness does not apply. The damage decreases by 1 each round. Antidotes, both physical and magical, can remove this status.

#### Prone

One of the classics—you drop to the ground to get a stable shot and make yourself tougher to shoot. The character’s movement rate is reduced to two yards, and they cannot Sprint. They get a +3 bonus on Defense Tests against ranged attacks from Medium range or farther, but –3 on attacks from Close or Near ranges due to their immobility. They also get a –4 penalty to melee attacks or bow attacks. They increase the Attack Rating of any firearm or projectile weapon (besides bows) by 2.

#### Silent #

Your ability to make noise is greatly hindered. The number after the status indicates the threshold step people must hit on a Perception test to hear the character with this status. Microphones and other inorganic methods of audio detection can pick up sounds of someone with this status as normal.

#### Silent (Improved) #
The same as Silent, except microphones and other forms of technology are also affected.

#### Stilled

There’s bad news and good news! The bad news is you can’t move. Your feet are absolutely stuck in place. You get a –10 penalty on your Defense Rating against incoming attacks (minimum 0), and you can’t take any actions beyond Perception and mental communication, should you be able to do that. You also cannot roll tests. The good news is, being Stilled halts any ongoing damage or other effects on the character. New damage may be inflicted, but any ongoing effects from it will also be canceled by this status.

#### Stunned
- A stunned creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can’t move, and can speak only falteringly.
- The creature automatically fails reactions
- Defense Score is at a -3 penalty.

#### Unconcious
- An Unconscious character is Incapacitated, can’t move or speak, and is unaware of their surroundings.
- The character drops whatever they’re holding and falls Prone.
- Any attack that hits the character is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet.

#### Wet

Whether it’s a pouring rain, a sudden wave, or the efforts of a rampaging water spirit, you are soaked from head to toe. You take double damagefrom cold and electricity damage. Cancels the Burning status, is canceled by the Burning status, and may affect the Corrosive status.

#### Zapped

A jolt of electrical power has hit you, leaving you fried and scattered. Your muscles aren’t working quite right, either. The character suffers a –2 to their Initiative Score, the inability to take the Sprint Action, and a penalty of –1 on all actions.

### Damage Types

Certain weapons and attacks deliver damage besides simple kinetic energy transfer. These forms of attacks, such as flamethrowers, fireballs, lightning bolts, tasers, and toxic waves to name a few, usually have a secondary and/or extended Status effect beyond the initial attack and damage result.

#### Electricity

Getting zapped not only hurts, but it also seizes muscles and leaves a victim shaky from muscle tremors. If a character shakes off the damage, they’re all good, but if they suffer even a single box, the character gets the Zapped status for 2 combat rounds.

#### Chemical (acids, bases, caustics, etc.) 

Attacks that involve corrosive chemicals—acids, bases, caustics, toxins, etc.—tend to stick around and cause damage on subsequent rounds. Chemical attacks add the Corrosive status. Additionally, if the modified Damage Value of an attack exceeds the Armor of the target, the Defense boost from that piece of armor is permanently decreased by one after the attack is resolved.

#### Cold

No one likes being cold. The shakes, chattering teeth, hypothermia, and tissue damage are just a few reasons your life will be harder after you get hit by a cold-based attack. Taking damage from an attack with a Cold damage type inflicts the Chilled status for 3 combat rounds. Lastly, if the modified Damage Value of an attack exceeds the Armor of the target, the Defense boost from that piece of armor is permanently decreased by one after the attack is resolved.

#### Fire

Once you’re hit by an attack that involves fire, the fire ignites flammable objects, including you. This effect means the fire burns for several rounds after the first. Taking damage from an attack with a Fire damage type inflicts the Burning status.

Gamemaster note: The damage and duration are subject to your discretion if the target has some mitigating circumstance. If they’re covered in oil or wearing a lot of loose-fitting cloth, it may last longer, cause more damage, or require a higher threshold to extinguish.



## Chapter 9: Magic

The world is made up of two parts.

The Sleeping World & The Awakened World.

The Sleeping World is unaware of magic. This Chapter focuses on the Awakened World.

The Awakened world is permeated by mana, the energy of magic. Mana is invisible and intangible. It cannot be detected, measured, or influenced by machines, only by living beings. Mana is sensitive. to emotion and responds to the will of the Awakened. It allows magicians to cast spells. Mana also makes the powers of adepts and various Awakened creatures possible.

**Magic Attribute**

Awakened creatures and magical effects have their magical potency measured by either the Magic or Force attributes. Magic is the attribute possessed by Awakened creatures—including humanoids while Force is the principle attribute for magic items and entities of pure mana—spirits and spells.

Magic is a Special attribute that measures the character’s magical power. Like other attributes, Magic has a starting value of 1. The Magic attribute may be increased in the same way as other attributes, to a maximum of 6. Magical study and insight can raise a magician’s Magic attribute beyond the normal maximum though a process called initiation.

If a character’s Magic is ever reduced to 0, she can no longer perform any kind of magic. The magician has “burned out,” losing all magical ability and becoming a mundane forever. She retains all magical skills and knowledge, but lacks the ability to use them. Active skills become Knowledge skills. 

Spells, spirits, and magic items have an attribute known as Force. This measures the magical power of the object, spell, or being. Force is measured on the same scale as humanoid attributes (natural 1 to 6). For spells and items, this is often their only attribute.

**The Three Realms**

Magicians are aware of three “realms” of existence. The first is the physical realm, our natural physical world, and all of its corresponding physical laws. 

On one “side” of us, we have the astral realm. The astral realm occupies the same “space” as the physical plane, but has different “physical” (“astral?”) laws. It is always there, right next door, just a step sideways. It thrives on life, and so emotion, thought, and spirit are emphasized on the astral. Without life, there is no astral space; and so without a thriving gaiasphere to support it, the astral plane does not extend into space. Using what is often called their "third eye" Magicians can see the Astral realm.

On the other side (and curving around, as it were, to meet the astral plane on its far edge) we have the metaplanar realm. The metaplanes are not one place but many, and their true nature and purpose are beyond the ken of ordinary magicians. (See The Planes)

Each realm is separated by a barrier, a wall of sorts that stops us from randomly wandering from one realm into another. Magicians have learned to extend their senses onto the astral realm, to astrally perceive what goes on there. Full magicians can actually leave their physical bodies and project their spirits onto the astral plane. Psychic travel to the metaplanes is also possible, but is a much more complicated affair.

**Magical Lodges**

In order to progress in her studies, a magician must have a collection of symbols, writings,
tools, and other material that allows her to record her progress, gives her room to expand her
knowledge, and assists her in her magical endeavors. Such a collection of items and information is known as a magical lodge. Magicians of the same tradition can share a magical lodge.

A magical lodge is required to improve Magic-linked skills, learn new spells, and perform Ritual Spellcasting. A lodge has a Force rating that is used to measure its power. The Force of a lodge must be at least equal to the skill rating being learned or the force of a spell being cast.

A lodge has a Resource cost of 2 per Force point, and the lodge’s rating can be improved later.

For example if you want to purchase a Force 1 Lodge you need to make a {Threshold} 12 Resource test. A Force 3 Lodge would be a {Threshold} 16. 

The money is spent to buy the supplies used to build the lodge. Once the supplies are gathered, the magician must complete an activation ritual that will “awaken” the lodge and construct its astral presence. The actual process requires 1 day per point of Force desired. An activated lodge acts as an astral barrier. Any magicians involved in the activation of the lodge are unaffected by this barrier, and can allow other astral forms to pass through it at will. A lodge contains the astral signatures of the magicians who activated it (see Astral Signatures), and is magically linked to them. This link can be tracked using astral projection (see Astral Tracking).

To increase the rating of an existing lodge, additional materials must be acquired. An activation ritual must also be performed, taking a number of days equal to the difference between the current Force and the desired Force. The cost of searching and gathering can be simplified to a cost of Resource 2 per Force point as above. Improving a Force 4 lodge to Force 6, for example, would cost Resource {Threshold} 22 (6 * 2 + 10) and take two days of ritual.

### Spellcasting

When a magician casts a spell, the player first chooses the Force of the spell and then rolls her `3D6 + Spellcasting + Magic VS {Threshold}`. Other sources of power (foci, spirit spellcasting aid) and Visibility modifiers may affect the final outcome. The success of a spell is measured by the {Threshold} on the test.

Many times the {Threshold} is the targets Defense for targeted spells. 

Steps for Spellcasting:

- Step 1: Choose a Spell. She can cast any spell she knows. Remember you can only have one Concentration Spell active at a time.
- Step 2: Choose the Force. The maximum Force a spell can be cast at equals the spellcaster’s Magic rating x 2. 
- Step 3: Choose the targets. Area spells you choose a location for the center, targeted spells you choose a target withing Line of Sight.
- Step 4: Make the Spellcasting Test. `3D6 + Spellcasting + Magic` VS {Threshold}. (Unless opposed the {Threshold} is 10 + Force)
- Step 5: Determine the effect. Some spells only require a success and the Effect determines how effective the spell is. Opposed test against living targets often trigger Willpower or other Reactions. Spells cast on astral objects like mana barriers or active foci are resisted with Force. **The Effect CANNOT exceed the Spells Force**
- Step 6: Fatigue Test. `3D6 + Willpower VS. 9 + Spells Force` if you succeed you cast it with minimal issues, if you fail you suffer effects (see Spell Fatigue below)
- Step 7: Concentration. Many spells can be sustained for as long as the magician is willing to concentrate on the spell, as noted in the spell’s Duration. If you take damage while maintaining concentration you must succeed on a `3D6 + Willpower Vs 10 or Half Damage taken rounded down up to 25 whichever is higher`

### Counterspelling

**This is considered a Reaction.**

Counterspelling is used to interrupt other spells, either as they are being cast or while they are sustained. To interrupt a spell as it is being cast a Counterspelling roll `3D6 + Counterspelling + Magic` is rolled versus the opposing Spellcasting roll `3D6 + Spellcasting + Magic`, if the Counterspell is higher the spell is canceled. Force does not come into play here because the Spell has not been completed yet.

For example Paige is fighting another Mage in a bar. The other Mage is preparing to cast Fireball. Paige rolls `3D6 + Counterspelling + Magic` she has a Counterspelling of 4 and a Magic of 5, the rolls a 12 and ends up with a 21. The enemy Mage has a Magic of 4 and a Spellcasting of 4, rolls a 12 on 3D6. Since Paige beat the enemy Mage's roll the spell is Countered and no Fireball is cast. 

When dispelling it is very similar, a Counterspelling + Magic Opposed Test is made against the target spell’s Force + caster’s Magic, if the roll is greater than the {Threshold} of the spell it is dispelled.

For Example if Paige is trying to dispel a sealed door. She rolls `3D6 + Counterspelling + Magic vs {Threshold} from the Gamemaster`. The GM knows that the caster had a Force of 6 for the spell and their magic was 6 so `{Threshold} = 10 + 6 + 6` the {Threshold} is 22.


### Force

A spell’s only attribute is its Force—the measure of the spell’s raw power. A spell’s Force helps determine its effectiveness and its Fatigue. Thee Force of a spell is chosen by the caster during spellcasting, typically at a value up to the Magic attribute of the magician who cast it. The maximum Force that a spell can be cast at is equal to twice the character’s Magic.

For simplicity, you may wish to decide that spells are always cast at a Force equal to the character’s Magic attribute unless otherwise noted. This certainly makes tracking Fatigue rolls easier.

A spell’s Force limits the Effect that can be achieved on the Spellcasting Test. So if you cast a Force 3 spell and get 5 Effect, only 3 of those count. In other words, Force has a limiting effect on spells—the more oomph you put into the spell, the better you can succeed with it. 

### Spell Fatigue 

When using a power, the player rolls a fatigue test for the character. This is a test with a target number of `{Threshold} = 9 + Spells Force / 2 rounded down`. Often times spells have a Fatigue Value or FV listed this represents the `Spell Force / 2 Rounded down` math already done.

Fatigue tests are Willpower Reactions. `3D6 + Willpower VS. 9 + Fatigue Value`

If the test succeeds, using the power costs the character only negligible effort. If the fatigue test fails, the character takes the Fatigue Value in Stun Damage (see Stun Damage) if they suffer enough Stun damage to reduce them to zero Physical Health they are Stunned for 1 Minute. After that they are 1 point away from Stunned and Exhausted.

- Exhausted: The character is nearly spent. An exhausted character has a –3 penalty to all tests, moves at half their normal speed, and cannot Run or Charge. 

Additionally, if the character loses more than half their Physical Health while exhausted, they become unconscious for 1d6 hours, or until restored to greater than half their maximum Physical Health. After 6 hours unconscious, they regain 10 + Body in Physical Health and regain consciousness.


Characters can recover from fatigue by resting, as follows:
- Taking a 5-minute breather is enough to recover BOD + STR in Stun Damage. You gain this benefit in addition to the normal amount of Physical Health you recover from a breather.
- Resting for at least 4 hours, with only light activity (talking, reading, and the like, but not standing or riding) allows you to recover from all Stun Damage, so long as you also eat and drink something during that time.
- Sleeping for at least 6 hours allows you to recover from being exhausted, as well as all Stun Damage in addition to the Physical Health benefits of such rest.

**Optional Rule**

Simple Fatigue.

Gamemasters and players should keep the following system in mind for making spell Fatigue calculation easier. Rather than choosing the Force and calculating the Fatigue each time a spell is cast, simply assume that spells are always cast at a Force equal to the character’s Magic attribute. In this case, the Fatigue for each spell can be pre-calculated and written on the character sheet, so you do not have to bother calculating it during actual gameplay.

If a character decides at some point to cast a spell at a different Force value, simply modify the Fatigue by +1 or –1 for every 2 points the player increases or decreases the Force, respectively.

For example, a player who has a mage with Magic 5 can assume that she always casts her Acid Stream spell at Force 5, and so she writes the Fatigue down as FV 5 (based on Acid Stream’s Fatigue formula for Force 5). If she decides to cast the spell at Force 3 instead, the Fatigue is modified to FV 4 (base FV 5 minus 1 per 2 points of Force reduction). If she decides to cast it at Force 7, her FV would be 6 (+1 per 2 points)—and the Fatigue if failed would be Physical Damage in lieu of Fatigue (see overcasting below) as the Force exceeds her Magic.

### Overcasting

If a caster wants the Spells Force to exceed their Magic Rating (maximum force is Magic x 2) they will suffer more dangerous outcomes than simple fatigue. If they fail the Fatituge test they will take the Fatigue Value as Damage instead of suffering Exhaustion levels as above. 

For example is Paige has a Magic of 5 and decides to cast Acid Stream at Force 7 the Fatigue Value (based on the spells formula) would be 6. Since The Force 7 exceeds Paige's Magic if she fails her Fatigue check (`3D6 + Willpower VS. {Threshold} 15`) Paige will take 6 points of Physical damage instead of suffering exhaustion. 

While dangerous it represents a magician putting their life into a spell. In some settings, some spells **require** it to be physical.

### Learning New Spells

Before a magician can cast a spell, she must learn it. A magician can learn a spell from either a spell formula or from another magician, but the source has to be of a compatible tradition (gamemaster’s discretion). A magician must have a magical lodge in order to experiment with and master what she has learned, adapting it to her own personal style and understanding of the magical world.

For most magicians (especially mages), the archaic master-apprentice model of learning a spell has largely passed by the wayside. Given the proliferation of magical information on the Net, learning from formulae has become the default method of learning new spells. Finding a spell formula is as easy as checking the Net. 

Certain spells (especially combat spells and mental manipulations) are illegal or controlled in some jurisdictions, so characters must engage caution when pursuing them, or look to black market providers/teachers. In addition, a character must expend 5 permanent Experience points per spell learned. The costs are the same whether the instruction is in person or through the Net.

Once a magician has access to a spell formula or teacher, she makes a Spellcasting + Logic (15,5, 1 day) Extended Test (see Extended Tests). Instructors can provide Help and grnt advantage on the tests. All injury modifiers apply, as do distractions for sustaining spells, poor conditions, and so on.

A character engaged in learning a spell must work on it for consecutive days. Learning a spell does not require all of the character’s
attention during those days, but the magician must be able to devote 8 hours each day solely to learning the spell until she has it mastered.
Should a day be missed before the test is completed, the character automatically fails the test and does not learn the spell. No Experience is expended in this case, but any money and time spent on instruction is lost. 

### Traditions

#### Hermetic Tradition

Concept: The scientific study of magic as a complex pattern of elemental forces that can be controlled with the right formulae and rituals.

- Combat: Fire Magic
- Detection: Air Magic
- Physical Health: Man
- Illusion: Water Magic
- Maniuplation: Earth Magic

A hermetic magician’s ability to perform magic comes from the study of a complex set of theories that describe mana, the dimensions of astral space, and how they interact with the physical world. The science of thaumaturgy, as this discipline is called, draws those who rely on logic and reason as their means of evaluating the world. As with any vibrant field, while the basics are largely agreed upon, the theories as to how it all works and what magic can do are as varied as the mages themselves. By seeking understanding, mages can perform magic through ritual and focused power of will.

Mages are scholars who study and practice magic using tried and established formulas and procedures. Mages continually research the theories and laws of magic, seeking a deeper understanding of the structure of the universe. As their knowledge increases, so does their power.

In Veilstriders Hermetic Mages attend school at Arkham in Mass. 

Examples: Harry Dresden

#### Sorcerous Tradition

Concept: The channeling of internal magical power through an object to manifest power

- Combat: Air Magic
- Detection: Earth Magic
- Physical Health: Water Magic
- Illusion: Man
- Maniuplation: Fire Magic

This tradition is taught to people who are born with magical latent ability. Taught to channel it through an object like a wand.

Examples: Harry Potter

#### Shamanic Tradition

- Combat: Beasts
- Detection: Water
- Physical Health: Earth
- Illusion: Air
- Manipulation: Man

To a shaman, the world is filled with living spirits, powers the shaman calls on for magical aid. Shamanic magicians summon spirits that are tied to nature: air, earth, water, beasts, and man. To a shaman, these are the spirits of the natural world. They are spirits of skies and storms, of mountains and valleys, of lakes and rivers, of birds and rats, and of the mass of humanity, for even man is a part of nature. Communion and trafficking with such spirits is a venerable and honored tradition among shamans.

Examples: Native American Magic.

### The Astral World

While the physical realm is the world characters know and walk in every day, another realm exists alongside it, invisible and unnoticed by most of the people on the planet. that place is called the astral plane, a sort of photo-negative of the physical world where only living things—things infused with mana—are real.

Mana, the essence of magic, flows from the metaplanes into our physical world and through it to the astral plane, where it pools and infuses the astral plane with its nature.

The astral plane is fueled by the life force that exists in and on our planet, and the general aura of that force illuminates the astral world at all times with an ambient glow. Things that exist only on the physical plane can be seen and heard from the astral, albeit with blurred features and indistinct sound—emotional content registers far more strongly than exact details. 

#### Astral Willpower

Many Awakened characters can perceive the astral plane from the physical world. This ability is called astral perception sometimes called "Third Eye". It is the primary sense used in the astral plane; it shows auras, allowing magicians to examine living creatures in the physical world as well as creatures who live on the astral plane. Astral Willpower is available to characters who take the Magician quality during character generation.

It takes a Minor Action to shift one’s perception from the astral to the physical, and another to shift it back again (it is not possible to see both at the same time, though almost everything in physical space is reflected on the astral, albeit without detail). A character using astral perception is considered dual-natured, active on both the physical and astral planes simultaneously.

While astral perception allows an Awakened character to sense the astral plane, actually interpreting what is sensed takes practice. Interpreting auras to gain information about the person or thing to whom they belong is called Assensing. A magician who wishes to learn more about an aura must make an Assensing test `Magic + Perception Rating` test against the {Threshold} as outlined on the Assensing Table (below). Without attempting to read an aura, a magician can still get an impression of what type of aura it is (spell, spirit, living creature, etc.).

Like physical perception, a character using astral perception should not need to make a test to see things that are immediately obvious (and since astral forms are bright and vibrant, this means that most astral forms are easily noticed). An actual test should only be called for when an astral being is specifically trying to hide, or when a character is trying to astrally observe in detail; in both these situations, an Assensing Test is made.

By assensing something’s aura, a magician can gain information. The auras of living beings show their general health, emotions, and magical nature (if any). Enchanted objects show their magical nature. Non-magical and non-living objects have only gray, lackluster shadows rather than auras, but pick up impressions from being in contact with living auras. Assensing can read any impressions left behind on an object.

Spells cast upon an individual show up as a separate aura surrounding that person for the duration of the spell. Once a spell has been rendered permanent, the aura is no longer present. It is occasionally possible to see the traces that magic spells leave behind in a target’s aura; see Astral Signatures for more information.

Whenever you have to perform a physical, non-magical task (shooting a gun, driving a car, and so forth) while astrally perceiving, you suffer Disadvantage on the roll. While astrally perceiving, a magician can cast mana spells at astral opponents. Other astral forms can engage an astrally perceiving magician in astral combat or cast mana spells at him as well.

Astral perception is a psychic sense that is not linked to the character’s physical sight. A blind magician can still magically perceive the astral plane and the creatures and auras within. Likewise, deaf magicians can “hear” in astral space.

| 30          | An accurate diagnosis of any disease or toxins which afflict the subject. Who their first born child is, what they had for breakfast              |


#### Astral Signatures

Magical skills and abilities produce an astral signature on anything affected by them, which is detectable using assensing. An astral signature is the magical “fingerprint” of the Awakened creature who created it. A signature lasts for a number of hours equal to a magical effects Force after the effect ends. Foci and other magical items (like magical lodges) always contain the astral signature of their owner (or owners). A character can attempt to read an astral signature with an Assensing Test. A {Threshold} 20+ is required to detect the signature. Once seen, a signature can be recognized if the character sees it again (perhaps requiring a memory test). With a {Threshold} 25, she also gets an impression of what magical effect created the signature (the magical skill used and the general class of spell or spirit).

Magical forensic investigators use astral signatures to gather information about criminal magicians, so characters should be careful about leaving astral signatures where they are likely to be seen by anyone who knows them.

A magician using astral perception may take a number of Complex Actions equal to the Force of an astral signature to erase it completely.

### Initiation

As Awakened characters grow in power, they often find that their initial explorations into magic and the astral plane can only take them so far in understanding and increasing their abilities. In order to increase their powers, magicians will often choose to undergo initiation in the mysteries of magic, the astral world, and the metaplanes in hope of increasing their connection with the Awakened world.

Initiation is measured in grades, beginning with Grade 1 and increasing. At the end of a character’s first initiation, she is a Grade 1 initiate. When she completes her second initiation, she is a Grade 2 initiate, and so on. The numerical system is for tracking initiation levels in game terms: each tradition refers to grades of initiation in their own way. 

The cost to initiate is equal to 10 + (Grade x 3) in Experience points. Characters who wish to initiate must pay that cost in order to achieve their new grade.
 
A character’s initiate grade cannot exceed her Magic attribute. If a character’s Magic is reduced below her initiate grade, she loses that level of initiation and the metamagic she gained with it.

#### Initiate Powers

**Increased Magic**

An initiate’s natural maximum for the Magic attribute is 6 + her grade of initiation. She will still have to pay normally to increase her Magic attribute. 

**Metaplanar Access**

Upon a character’s first initiation, a character usually gains access to a special Demiplane for their Initiation. 

**More Powers**

Some settings have more powers for Initiation.

How to read a spell.

- Category: This describes the manner in which a spell affect its target, as well as what spirits will be associated with that type of spell. The categories are: Combat, Detection, Physical Health, Illusion, and Manipulation.
- Type: Spell Type is either mana (M) or physical (P). Mana spells affect their targets through the mana that permeates the astral and physical planes affecting the target in a magical and spiritual manner that is only effectively resisted by the Willpower of a living or magical being. Physical spells directly target the body; resistance relies on the target’s Stamina. Only mana spells can affect astral forms. Either type of spell may be used in the physical world, but mana spells cannot affect non-living targets.
- Range: All spells have a range at which they can be cast. For most spells, the range is line of sight (LOS). If the caster can see the target, regardless of distance, it can be affected. Some spells, particularly health spells, require the caster to touch the intended target in order for the spell to work. Other spells affect all valid targets within an area, defined as a circle with a radius equal to the spell’s Force in yards.
- Test & {Threshold}: The type of test required if opposed, or the {Threshold} required (usually 10 + Force)
- Duration: Duration is either Instant, Concentration, or Permanent. Instant spells end the moment they are cast, and their full effects are felt immediately. Concentration spells last for as long as the magician concentrates on them. Permanent spells must be Concentrationated for a short time, after which their effects become “natural” and no longer require magic or concentration to maintain. The time required to make a spell’s effects permanent is equal to twice the Fatgiue Value in Combat Turns.
- Fatigue Value: This describes the Fatigue Value required for the Fatigue Test. Fatigue is based on the spell’s Force; the more powerful the spell, the more exhausting it is to cast. Fatigue is variable, based on the spell’s Force ÷ 2, rounded down, and modified by Fatigue modifiers appropriate to each spell. Failed Fatigue Tests cause Stun Damage and possibly Exhaustion (see Spell Fatigue above), unless the spell is overcast (cast at a Force higher than the magician’s Magic see above), in which case it causes Fatigue Value in Physical damage. Note that no Fatigue Value can ever be less than 1.


### Combat Spells

Combat spells use mana to create damaging effects, either by direct or indirect means. Think of Direct spells as Saving Throw Spells and Indirect Spells as To Hit Spells. Though Indirect Area spells require a Quickness Reaction.

Direct Combat spells channel damaging power directly into the target’s inner being, affecting them from within, and so bypass armor (but not Toughness). 

Indirect Combat spells create an external damaging medium (often elemental in nature) that is used to attack the target. 

**Direct Combat Spells**: Handle these as an Opposed Test. The caster’s `Spellcasting + Magic` is resisted by the target’s Stamina (for physical spells) or Willpower (for mana spells), plus Counterspelling (if available). 

The caster needs beat the opposed roll by at least 1 to take effect. Direct Combat spells affect the target from the inside, so armor does not help with resistance. Toughness does help with the damage though.

> For example Paige casts Manabolt at a Security Guard. She has a 5 Spellcasting and 5 Magic. She rolls `3D6 + 5 + 5` she rolls 17 the Security Guard has a Stamina of 3 and no Counterspell so he rolls `3D6 +3` to resist the spell.

Direct Combat spells cast against nonliving objects are treated as Success Tests; the caster must achieve Effect to beat the item’s Object Resistance. Effect increase damage as normal (the object does not get a resistance test).

Direct Combat spells involve channeling mana directly into a target as destructive and damaging energies rather than generating a damaging effect. Affecting the target on this fundamental level with raw mana requires more focus and more power than producing other spell effects. After the Spellcasting is resisted the caster choses whether or not to apply any Effect to increase the damage value of the spell as normal.

**Indirect Combat Spells**: Indirect Combat spells are treated like ranged combat attacks; the caster makes a `Spellcasting + Magic` Success Test versus the target’s Defense. 

Indirect Combat spells (also commonly called AOE spells) generate a spell construct at the point of origin (the caster) which travels down the mystic link to the chosen target, whereupon it discharges and the effect defined in the spell description manifests. The spell traverses the distance between the caster and the target near instantly, but travels over the physical or astral plane to do so only to take effect when it “hits”. Hence, Indirect Spells are handled as ranged attacks and require a physically solid target or astrally active target to hit. As they travel down the link to the chosen target such effects may be impeded by physical obstacles or mana barriers. They may impact transparent obstacles (such as glass) and do not “bounce” off reflective surfaces used for line of sight. Instead the spell takes effect at the point of contact with an obstructing barrier. In the case of mana barriers, use the standard rules for casting through barriers, but if the spell’s Force is insufficient to beat the mana barrier it “fizzles” at the point of contact with the barrier.

If the spell reaches the chosen target and it fails to dodge with Quickness (+ Counterspelling, if available) ({Threshold} 10 + Spells Force), the target then resists damage with Toughness + armor. Each point reduces the Damage Value. The target takes the damage left over, if any after the Toughness and Armor Protection is deducted. Note that nonliving objects resist damage from an Indirect Combat spell with their Armor rating x 2 (see Barriers). Note that unlike other spells, Indirect Combat spells may affect other targets that the caster cannot see if they are caught within the spell’s area of effect.

**Elemental Effects**: Many Indirect Combat spells utilize damaging elemental energies such as Fire damage, Electrical damage, etc (see Damage Types).

Spells with elemental components also create secondary effects on the environment. For example, a Fireball might start fires, cook off ammo, ignite fuel tanks, and set fire to armor and clothing all over the blast zone. An Acid Stream can melt surrounding material into smoking sludge. These are noted in the special case damage descriptions.

**Damage Value**: The base Damage Value for Combat spells is based on Force in flat damage, which is chosen by the magician at the time of casting. Any Effect scored on the Spellcasting Test increase the Damage Value by 1D6 per Effect. Each spell description notes whether damage is Stun (S) or Physical (P).

#### Acid Spells

These Spells create a powerful corrosive that sprays the target, causing terrible burns and eating away organic and metallic material—treat it as Acid damage, with appropriate effects on the affected area and any objects therein. The acid quickly evaporates in the turn following the spell’s casting, but the damage done remains. Acid Stream is a single-target spell. While Toxic Wave is an area spell.

##### Acid Stream (Indirect, Elemental)

### Detection Spells

Detection also known as Divination spells give the subject a new sense, beyond the normal five senses, for as long as they are maintained. They are cast upon either the magician or a subject within Touch range. Using the sense may require the subject to take a Minor Action to Perception in Detail. Detection spells are either directional (like normal sight), area effect (work in all directions at once, like hearing), or psychic (providing some other special “sense” such as telepathy or precognition). Additionally the sense is either active or passive (see below).

**Active**: The sense actively analyzes or seeks out certain information when the subject concentrates on it. Active Detection spells are treated as an Opposed Test, pitting the caster’s `Spellcasting + Magic vs. The target’s Willpower (+ Counterspelling, if available)`; magical objects resist with Force. Against objects, handle the spell as a Success Test with a {Threshold} based on the Object Resistance. The Detection Spell Results table provides guidelines for how thoroughly the sense works, based on Effect scored. Note that Counterspelling may be used to defend against active Detection spells, even if the magician is not aware of them (see Counterspelling).

**Passive**: A passive sense is simply “on” and passes along any appropriate sensory input without any sort of interpretation (similar to hearing). The Spellcasting Test serves as a magical Willpower test, against an appropriate {Threshold} determined by the gamemaster. Other effects are noted in the spell descriptions. The Detection Spell Results table provides guidelines for how thoroughly the sense works, based on Effect.

Note that Counterspelling cannot be used to “defend” against the sense provided by passive Detection spells.

**Range**: The standard sensory range for a Detection spell is the spell’s `Force x Magic` in yards. For extended range Detection spells, the effective range of the new sense is `Force x Magic x 10 yards`. Note that any of the standard range spells listed below may be learned with an extended range instead (adding +2 FV).

Note also that a separate test is not needed for each potential target in range of the sense. The character simply makes a single `Spellcasting + Magic Test` and compares the results against each potential target in range, using the Detection Spell Results table to determine the result. If a caster sustains a Detection spell, new targets may be detected as they enter the range of the spell; in this case, the gamemaster simply applies the results of the original `Spellcasting + Magic Test` to see if the new targets are noticed.

**Glitches**: A glitch on a Detection Spellcasting Test may result in false or misleading information. Likewise, a critical glitch may inflict extra (+2 FV) or Physical Drain, may temporarily strip the character of a sense, or may inexplicably apply the sense to others (particularly opponents) in range.

**Detection Results Table**
| {Threshold} | Results                                                                                                                                     |

#### Analyze Device (Active, Directional)
- Type: P 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2)

This spell allows the subject to analyze the purpose and operation of a device or piece of equipment within range of the sense. The caster must gain enough hits on the Spellcasting Test to beat the item’s Object Resistance. Each Effect gives the subject a +1 while operating the device, and allows the subject to ignore any skill defaulting modifiers for using the device while the spell is sustained.


#### Analyze Truth (Active, Directional)
- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2)

The subject can tell whether a target’s statements are the truth. Halftruths or falsehoods the target believes to be true are not detected by this spell.

The subject must hear a statement in person (with the target within range) to know whether it is true.

#### Clairaudience (Passive, Directional)
- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) –1

The subject can hear distant sounds as if physically present at a chosen point within the sensory range of the spell. The “listening point” may be moved to any other point within range of the spell. While using clairaudience, the subject cannot use her normal hearing. This spell does not translate visual images, only sounds (and only sounds within the subject’s natural range of hearing; augmented hearing does not apply).

#### Clairvoyance (Passive, Directional)
- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) –1

The subject can see distant scenes as if physically present at a chosen point within the sensory range of the spell. The “visual point” may be moved to any other point within range of the spell. The subject cannot use normal vision or astral perception while using it. This spell does not translate sound, only vision. Any augmented vision possessed by the subject does not function through this spell, nor does astral perception. Magicians cannot use clairvoyance to target others with spells.

#### Combat Sense (Active, Psychic)
- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 2

The subject can subconsciously analyze combat and other dangerous situations within range, sensing events a split-second before they happen. Every Effect on the Spellcasting Test adds +1 Reaction on Surprise Tests and when defending against ranged and melee attacks for the duration of the spell.

#### Detect Enemies (Active, Area)
- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1

#### Detect Enemies, Extended (Active, Extended Area)

- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 3

The subject can detect living targets within range who have hostile intentions toward him. The spell does not detect traps (since they are not alive), nor can it detect someone about to shoot into a crowd at random (the hostility is not directed at the subject of the spell). The spell can detect targets preparing an ambush or other surprise attack.

#### Detect Individual (Active, Area)
- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) – 1

The subject can detect the presence of a particular individual anywhere within range of the sense. The magician names the individual during casting; she must know the target or have met him in the past.

- Duration: S

- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2)

#### Detect Magic, Extended (Active, Extended Area)
- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S

#### Detect [Object] (Active, Area)
- Type: P 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) –1

The subject detects all of a specified type of object within range of the sense and knows their number and relative location. Each type of object requires a separate spell (Detect Guns, Detect Computers, Detect Explosives, and so forth).

#### Mindlink (Active, Psychic)
- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1

Mindlink allows the caster and one voluntary subject to communicate mentally, exchanging conversation, emotions, and mental images. One Effect on the Spellcasting Test is enough to establish the link. The subject must remain within range of the spellcaster for the Mindlink to work.

#### Mind Probe (Active, Directional)
- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 2

This spell allows the subject to telepathically probe the mind of a specific target within range of the sense (chosen when the spell is cast). The target is aware of the probing, though they may not know the source of the spell. If the caster gains one or more Effect, consult the Mind Probe Results table (below) for the information gained. The subject may probe for one piece of information per Major Action. Additional uses of Mind Probe against the same target within a number of hours equal to the target’s Willpower are at a –2 modifier per previous Spellcasting attempt.

**Mind Probe Results table**
| {Threshold} | Result                                                                                                     |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 15          | The subject can read the target’s surface thoughts only.                                                   |
| 20          | The subject can fi nd out anything the target consciously knows and view the target’s memories.            |
| 25          | The subject can probe the target’s subconscious, for psychological quirks, deep fears, or hidden memories. |

### Physical Health Spells

Physical Health spells can heal physical injury, cure diseases (or inflict them), detoxify poisons or drugs (or mimic their effects), as well as modify attributes. No techniques currently known to magic can erase Stun damage or cure psychological conditions.

All health spells require the caster to touch the subject of the spell. This “laying on hands” is traditional in magical healing lore the world over. Physical Health spells are handled as Success Tests, with Effect providing specified bonuses.

Negative Physical Health spells: Spells that negatively affect a character require an Opposed Test, pitting `Spellcasting + Magic vs. The target’s appropriate attribute (+ Counterspelling, if available)`.

#### Antidote

- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: P 
- FV: (Toxin DV) – 2

This spell helps a poisoned subject to overcome a toxin. It must be applied before the toxin does damage (though an Antidote spell applied afterward may alleviate some side effects, if the gamemaster chooses). The poisoned character receives a modifier on her Toxin Resistance Test (Stamina) equal to the Effect. 

#### Cure Disease

- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: P 
- FV: (Disease DV) – 2

This spell is used at any point after infection to help a patient overcome illness. The infected character receives a number of additional dice on her Disease Resistance Test equal to the spell’s Effect. It does not heal any damage already inflicted by the disease (that takes a separate Healing spell).

#### Decrease [Attribute] (Negative)

- Type: P 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1

This spell weakens the target by decreasing a chosen attribute. A version of this spell exists for each Physical and Mental attribute, but not for Special attributes (Initiative, Edge, Magic). It affects both natural and augmented attributes. The target resists the spell using the attribute affected. If the caster wins, the attribute is reduced by the spell’s Effect. If a Physical attribute is reduced to 0, the victim is incapacitated or paralyzed. If a Mental attribute is reduced to 0, the victim stands about mindlessly confused. Note that decreasing an attribute may affect other derived statistics.

#### Detox

- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: P 
- FV: (Toxin DV) – 4

Detox relieves the side effects of a drug or poison. The Force of the spell must equal or exceed the toxin’s base DV. A single Effect is sufficient to eliminate all symptoms. Detox does not heal or prevent damage done by toxins, but it eliminates any side effects they may have on the victim (dizziness, hallucinations, nausea, pain, and so forth). Detox is the hangover cure of choice among those who can afford it. 

#### Heal

- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: P 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) – 2

Heal repairs physical injuries. It heals an amount of Physical damage equal to the spell’s `Force + Effect from the Spellcasting Test`. Effect can also be used to reduce the base time for the spell to become permanent; each Effect spent this way shaves off 1 Combat Turn. A character can only be magically healed once for any single set of injuries. 

#### Hibernate

- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) – 3

The caster must touch a voluntary or unconscious subject. The spell puts the subject in a form of suspended animation. The subject’s bodily processes are slowed by a factor equal to the Effect. For example, If the Effect was 4, the subject’s metabolism is slowed by a factor of 4. Such a subject sealed into a chamber with enough air to keep it alive for a day would be able to last four days.

#### Increase [Attribute]

- Type: P 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) – 2

This spell increases an attribute (natural or augmented) on a voluntary subject. A version of this spell exists for each Physical and Mental attribute, but not for Special attributes (Initiative, Edge, Magic). The Force of the spell must equal or exceed the (augmented) value of the attribute being affected. The attribute is increased by an amount equal to the Effect scored. Each attribute can only be affected by a single Increase Attribute spell at a time.

Note that increasing an attribute may affect other derived statistics (Increase Reaction also affects Initiative, for example, while Increase Stamina will add extra boxes to the character’s Physical Condition Monitor for as long as the spell lasts).

#### Increase Reflexes

- Type: P 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 2

This spell increases the reflexes (Initiative) of a voluntary subject. Each level of increase adds +1 Initiative. The caster must achieve a certain Effect Threshold for each level:

- Effect 2: +1 Initiative
- Effect 3: +2 Initiative, +1 Major Action
- Effect 4 (max.): +3 Initiative, +2 Complex Actions

A character can only be affected by a single Increase Reflexes spell at a time.

#### Oxygenate

- Type: P 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) – 1

This spell oxygenates the blood of a voluntary subject, providing extra Stamina (+1 for every Effect) to resist suffocation, strangulation, the effects of inhaled gas, or any other effect of oxygen deprivation. The spell also allows the subject to breathe underwater.

#### Prophylaxis

- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) – 2

This spell provides additional Stamina (+1 per Effect) for a voluntary subject to resist infection, drugs, or toxins. The spell does not discriminate between harmful and beneficial drugs, so the subject also resists medicines and other helpful drugs while under the effects of the spell.  Reduce the effect of a beneficial drug by 1 for every Effect of the spell. Two or more Effect prevent the subject from being affected by alcohol while under the effect of this spell.

#### Resist Pain

- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: P 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) – 4

This spell allows the caster to have the same affect of the High Pain Threshold Quality for a number of rounds equal to the Force + Effect of the Spellcasting Test. 


#### Stabilize

- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: P 
- FV: (Overflow damage) – 2

When applied to a character who is at Physical Health 0 and dying, this spell stabilizes all vital functions and prevents the character from dying. The spell’s Force must equal or exceed the overflow damage already taken when the spell starts. The full time must be taken for the spell to become Permanent before the character is stabilized; Effect reduce the time it takes by 1 Combat Turn each. If successful, the spell prevents the character from taking further damage from Physical Damage Overflow.

### Illusion Spells

No matter how realistic they are, illusions cannot directly cause permanent harm. They can cause distractions, loss of balance or orientation, and even symptoms like nausea or pain. All such effects vanish as soon as the caster drops the illusion. Illusions can certainly cause harm by manipulating the senses so a victim walks into traffic or off a high building, for example, but they cannot directly cause damage.

Obvious illusions are used solely for entertainment and cannot fool subjects into believing they are real. Realistic illusions seem completely real. Single-sense illusions affect only one sense. Full sensory illusions affect all senses. Though mana-based illusions can be created on the astral plane, their magical auras give them away as illusions to anyone who makes a successful Assensing Test (see Astral Willpower). Illusions cannot fool assensing to disguise or create auras.

Mana Illusions: Mana-based illusion spells affect the mind and are ineffective against technological viewing systems like cameras. Mana illusions are resisted by Willpower + Counterspelling (if any). Some mana illusions affect the target’s senses directly, others affect the senses of anyone perceiving the subject of the spell (though the spellcaster is not affected by her own spell). 

Physical Illusions: Physical illusion spells create actual images or alter physical properties, such as light or sound. Physical illusions are effective against technological systems, assuming the caster achieves enough Effect to meet the Object Resistance Threshold. They are resisted by `Intuition + Counterspelling (if any)`; non-living devices do not get a resistance test. The spellcaster must generate more Effect than the observer for the illusion to be considered real. If the spell is not completely resisted, the character is fully affected by the illusion.

#### Confusion (Realistic, Multi-Sense)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2)


#### Mass Confusion (Realistic, Multi-Sense, Area)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 2


#### Chaos (Realistic, Multi-Sense)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1


#### Chaotic World (Realistic, Multi-Sense, Area)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 3


These spells produce a storm of conflicting sensations and images to confuse the senses. For each Effect on the Spellcasting Test, the target suffers a –1 modifier to all tests from the distraction. Confusion affects a single target. Mass Confusion is an area spell. The Chaos spell is a physical version of Confusion (above), so it also affects technological systems and sensing devices. Chaotic World is an area version of Chaos.

#### Entertainment (Obvious, Multi-Sense, Area)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1


#### Trid Entertainment (Obvious, Multi-Sense, Area)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 2


These area spells create obvious, but entertaining, illusions. Effect on the Spellcasting Test measure how creative, interesting, and captivating the audience finds the illusion. The caster can reproduce just about anything from her imagination, or re-create something she has experienced. The gamemaster might require additional hits for exacting detail. 

Entertainment affects the minds of the subjects and cannot be detected by non-living sensors. Trid Entertainment is a physical spell, and can be perceived by both living subjects and non-living sensors. These spells are used for amusement as well as art. The entertainment industry uses illusionists as literal “special effects wizards.” Magical designers and artists work to create new and interesting sensations, including sensations that can’t otherwise be experienced in the real world. Only the wealthy can afford the unique experiences offered by such spellcasters firsthand.

#### Invisibility (Realistic, Single-Sense)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2)


#### Improved Invisibility (Realistic, Single-Sense)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1


This spell makes the subject more difficult to detect by normal visual senses (including low-light, thermographic, and other senses that rely on the visual spectrum). The subject is completely tangible and detectable by the other senses (hearing, smell, touch, etc.). Her aura is still visible to astral perception. 

Anyone who might perceive the subject must first successfully resist the spell. Simply make one Spellcasting Test and use the result scored as the Threshold for anyone that resists at a later point. Even if the spell is resisted, the subject might remain unnoticed if she wins a Sneaking Test. An invisible character may still be detected by non-visual means, such as hearing or smell. Attacks against invisible targets suffer the Target Hidden modifier (disadvantage) if the attacker is unable to see or otherwise sense the subject of the spell. Invisibility affects the minds of viewers. Improved invisibility creates an actual warping of light around the subject that affects technological sensors as well.


This spell makes the subject more difficult to detect

by normal visual senses (including low-light, thermo-
graphic, and other senses that rely on the visual spec-
trum). The subject is completely tangible and detectable

by the other senses (hearing, smell, touch, and even

taste, if it somehow comes to that). Her aura is still visi-
ble to astral perception.

Anyone who might be in a position to perceive the
subject must first successfully resist the spell. Simply
make one Spellcasting Test and use the hits scored as
the Threshold for anyone that resists at a later point.
Even if the spell is resisted, the subject might remain
undetected if she’s good enough with her Sneaking Test. An invisible character may still be detected by non-visual means, such as hearing or smell. Attacks against invisible targets suffer the Blind Fire modifier if the attacker is unable to see or otherwise sense the subject of the spell.

Invisibility affects the minds of viewers. Improved Invisibility mimics the subject’s surroundings from all angles and affects technological sensors as well.

#### Mask (Realistic, Multi-Sense)

- Type: M 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2)


#### Physical Mask (Realistic, Multi-Sense)

- Type: P 
- Range: T 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1


The Mask spell requires the caster to touch the subject. The subject assumes a different physical appearance (of the same basic size and shape) chosen by the caster. This alters the subject’s voice, scent, and other physical characteristics as well. Anyone who might see through the disguise must first successfully resist the spell. Simply make one Spellcasting Test and use the result scored as the {Threshold} for anyone that resists at a later point.

Mask affects the minds of viewers. Physical Mask creates an illusion that affects technological sensors as well.

#### Phantasm (Realistic, Multi-Sense, Area)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) +2


#### Trid Phantasm (Realistic, Multi-Sense, Area)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) +3


These area spells create convincing illusions of any object, creature, or scene the caster desires. They can create an illusion of anything the caster has seen before, from a flower or a credstick to a dragon breathing fire, as long as the illusion is no larger than the spell’s area. Anyone who might pierce the illusion must successfully resist the spell. Simply make one Spellcasting Test and use the result as the Threshold for anyone that resists at a later point. Phantasm only affects living beings, while Trid Phantasm affects technological sensors as well. 

#### Hush (Realistic, Single-Sense, Area)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 2


#### Silence (Realistic, Single-Sense, Area)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 3


These spells create an area that damps sound. Sonic attacks into or out of the field, as well as critter powers using a sonic medium (such as Paralyzing Howl), are reduced by –1 per Effect on the Spellcasting Test. Anyone attempting to hear a sound from within or across the silenced area must successfully resist the spell.

Hush is a mana spell and so only affects living beings and magic sonic attacks. Silence affects technological devices and is useful for jamming alarms, detection devices, sonar, and tactical communications, as well as technological sonic weapons.

#### Sneaking (Realistic, Single-Sense)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) +1


Sneaking makes the subject less audible to normal hearing (including augmented hearing). The subject moves in silence, making less or no noise. Things not directly touched by the subject can still make noise, so a character under a Sneaking spell would make no noise knocking on a door, but the door would make noise hitting the floor or wall if it was kicked in.

Anyone who might hear the subject must first successfully resist the spell. Simply make one Spellcasting Test and use the result scored as the Threshold for anyone that resists at a later point. Even if the spell is resisted, the subject might remain unnoticed if she wins a Shadowing or Infiltration Test.

### Manipulation Spells

Manipulation spells control, animate, or transform matter and energy.
Many Manipulation spells have a Threshold; this is the number of
Spellcasting + Magic hits required for the spell to function. Mental
Manipulations affect the mind, Physical Manipulations affect physical
forms, and Environmental Manipulations affect conditions such as
light, temperature, gravity, etc. Most Manipulation spells are handled
as Success Tests, with hits determining the effect.

Mental Manipulations: For Mental Manipulation spells, the caster makes an Opposed Spellcasting + Magic Test against the target’s Willpower (+ Counterspelling, if available). If the caster scores more hits, she controls the target as noted in the spell description. Every (Force) Combat Turns, the victim may spend a Major Action to shake off the mental control. the victim rolls a Willpower (+ Counterspelling) Test; each hit reduces the Effect on the caster’s original Spellcasting Test. If the spellcaster’s Effect are reduced to 0, the spell no longer affects the target.

#### Armor (Physical)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 3

this spell creates a glowing field of magical energy around the subject that
protects against Physical damage. It provides both Ballistic and Impact
armor (cumulative with worn armor) to the subject equal to the hits scored. 

#### Control Actions (Mental)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2)

#### Mob Control (Mental, Area)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 2

the caster of this spell controls the physical actions of a target like a puppeteer pulling strings. the victim’s consciousness is unaffected, but the
caster controls the victim’s body. the target uses any skills or abilities at
the caster’s orders, but these tests suffer a  modifier equal to the
target’s Willpower because of the victim’s resistance to the caster’s commands. Controlling a target character requires the caster to spend a Simple
Action; when not directly controlled, the victim may act as normal.
Control Actions only affects a single target, Mob Control affects
any living targets within the area of effect. Victims of a Mob Control
may be manipulated individually (with separate Minor Actions) or
issued the same command as a group (with a single Minor Action).

#### Control Emotions (Mental)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2)

#### Mob Mood (Mental, Area)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 2

the target feels an overwhelming emotion chosen by the spellcaster (such
as love, hate, fear, joy, sorrow, and so forth). the target believes the emotion
wholeheartedly, but not mindlessly. A target who acts in accordance with
the emotion (for example, fighting while filled with anger or hate) suffers
no penalty. If the target takes action not relevant to the emotion (trying
to drive while laughing hysterically), she suffers a –2  modifier
for the distraction. the caster may switch emotions with a Minor Action.
Control Emotions only affects a single target, Mob Mood affects
any living targets within the area of effect.

#### Control Thoughts (Mental)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 2

#### Mob Mind (Mental, Area)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 4

the caster seizes control of the target’s mind, directing everything the
target does. the caster mentally gives commands with a Minor Action
and the target is compelled to obey

Control thoughts affects a single target, while Mob Mind affects
any living targets within the area of effect. Victims of a Mob Mind may
be manipulated individually (with separate Minor Actions) or issued
the same command as a group (with a single Minor Action)

#### Fling (Physical)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: I 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1

this spell psychokinetically hurls a single object of no more than
(Force) pounds at a designated target with a Strength equal to onehalf the spellcaster’s Magic. Treat the Spellcasting Test as a normal
Ranged Combat Test for the purposes of the item hitting the target.
throwing weapons propelled by this spell use their normal range based
on the spell’s effective Strength.

#### Ice Sheet (Environmental, Area)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: I 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 3

This spell creates a slippery sheet of ice over the area of effect.
Characters crossing the ice must make an Agility + Reaction Test with
a Threshold equal to the hits scored to avoid falling prone. Vehicles
must make a Crash Test. the sheet melts at a rate of 1 square
yard per minute in normal temperatures.

#### Ignite (Physical)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: P 
- FV: (F ÷ 2)

the Ignite spell accelerates molecular motion in the target, causing it
to catch fire once the spell becomes permanent. the spellcaster must
achieve enough Effect to beat a Threshold equal to the target’s Object
Resistance. Once the target ignites, it burns normally until it
is consumed or extinguished.
Against living targets, treat Ignite as an Opposed Test pitting
Spellcasting + Magic vs. Stamina (+ Counterspelling). If successful,
Ignite wraps a living target in heat and flames once it has been made
permanent, causing (Force) boxes of Fire damage on the first
Combat Turn, and increasing by one box of damage each additional
turn. Resolve the damage at the end of each Combat Turn by making
a Damage Resistance Test using the victim’s Stamina + half Impact armor.
Ammo or explosives carried by a victim may go off. the gamemaster
should reduce the Force of the fire accordingly for extinguishing efforts 



#### Influence (Mental)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: P 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1

this spell implants a single suggestion in the victim’s mind, like a powerful post-hypnotic command. the subject will carry out this suggestion as if it were her own idea and it will then fade. If confronted with
the wrongness of the suggestion, the subject can make a Willpower
Test to overcome it as described under Mental Manipulations.
the caster can also withdraw the suggestion at any time.

#### Levitate (Physical)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1

Levitate allows the caster to telekinetically lift a person or object and
move it around. the caster must achieve a Threshold on the Spellcasting
Test equal to 1 per 200 kg of the subject’s mass. the subject of the spell
can be moved anywhere in the caster’s line of sight at a Movement rate
equal to the spell’s Force x net Spellcasting hits in yards per turn.
Objects flung into other things should be handled as a Ranged
Attack Test (see Fling), inflicting a number of boxes of Stun damage as
decided by the gamemaster (especially sharp or dangerous objects may
do Physical damage at the gamemaster’s discretion).

If the caster is attempting to levitate an item held by a living being,
make an Opposed Test between the spell’s Force x 2 and the holder’s
Strength + Stamina. the caster must have at least 1 net hit to levitate the
item away. If the caster is attempting to levitate an unwilling living
being, the Opposed Test uses the target’s Strength + Stamina. You can use
this spell to levitate yourself, if desired.

#### Light (Environmental, Area)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) – 1

this spell creates a mobile point of light, illuminating a radius around
it equal to the spell’s Force in yards. the spell cannot be used to
blind, but does offset darkness visibility modifiers. Each hit on the
Spellcasting Test counters a –1 die penalty for visibility.

#### Magic Fingers (Physical)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1

Magic Fingers creates a psychokinetic effect like “invisible hands” that
can hold or manipulate items. the hits on the Spellcasting + Magic
Test become the spell’s effective Strength and Agility. the caster can use
skills remotely with Magic Fingers, but all tests receive a –2 
modifier due to problems of fine control. Even simple actions like picking up a coin may require an Agility Test, at the gamemaster’s discretion.
the caster can fight, pick a lock, or perform any other action,
using the magic fingers as if they were real hands. the spell can reach
any point the caster can see, and Clairvoyance or remote-viewing technology can be used to get a close-up of the scene as long as it is within
the caster’s normal line of sight. this spell comes in very handy for disarming bombs and handling other hazardous work from a safe distance.

#### Mana Barrier (Environmental, Area)

- Type: M 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1

Mana Barrier creates an invisible barrier of magical energy with a Force
equal to the Effect scored. this barrier does not restrict living beings
or physical objects, but it does impede spirits, foci, dual beings, and
spells. If cast on the astral plane, it also impedes astral forms and restricts visibility. Any target of a spell that is on the other side of the
Mana Barrier receives a bonus to its spell resistance  equal to
the barrier’s Force. If the target had no resistance , but instead
has an Object Resistance Threshold, increase the Threshold by 1 for
every increment of 3 Force in the Mana Barrier (round up). 

#### Petrify (Physical)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 2

Petrify transforms living tissue into stone-like calcium carbonate. the
caster must win an Opposed Test pitting her Spellcasting + Magic
against the target’s Stamina (+ Counterspelling). Additionally, the spell’s
Force must equal or exceed the target’s Stamina. Non-living material—
including clothing, gear, and cyberware—is not affected. the target
is not conscious while under the effects of this spell, and any damage
suffered by the stone-like form affects the target normally. While petrified, the subject has a barrier Armor rating equal to Stamina + Effect
(see Barriers).

#### Physical Barrier (Environmental, Area)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 3

Barrier spells create glowing, translucent force-fields with both 1 point
of Armor and Structure rating per hit (see Barriers). the caster
can form the barrier as a dome with a radius and height equal to the 
spell’s normal radius. the caster can also form a wall with a height and
length equal to the spell’s Force. the caster can adjust size of the barrier
the same as the radius of an area spell .
Physical Barrier creates a physical wall. Anything the size of a molecule (or less) can pass through the barrier, including air or other gases.
Anything bigger treats the barrier as a normal physical wall. Attacks
directed through a barrier have a –1  visibility penalty. the
barrier does not impede spells. the barrier can be brought down by
physical attacks, but as long as it is sustained it regenerates damage
quickly—any reductions in Structure Rating are restored at the beginning of the next Combat Turn. If the barrier is penetrated, however,
it collapses and the spell ends. Physical Barrier cannot be used on the
astral plane.

#### Poltergeist (Environmental, Area)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 3

Poltergeist picks up all small objects (up to a kilogram in mass) within
the spell’s area and whirls them around in random patterns. this imposes a –2  visibility penalty in the area. the spell inflicts
2 boxes of Stun damage (resisted with Reaction + Impact armor) to
anyone in the area each Combat Turn, whacking them with flying
debris. Poltergeist may do more damage in cluttered environments, or
inflict Physical damage if the gamemaster feels the debris is sufficiently
dangerous (broken glass and nails, for example).

#### Shadow (Environmental, Area)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS (A) 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1

Shadow creates a globe of darkness with a radius equal to the spell’s
Force in yards. Every hit imposes a –1 die pool visibility modifier
against targets within the area (maximum –6).

#### Shapechange (Physical)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 2

#### (Critter) Form (Physical)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 1

Shapechange transforms a voluntary subject into a normal (non-paranormal) critter, though the subject retains human consciousness. the
subject can only assume the form of a critter whose base Stamina rating
is 2 points greater or less than her own. Consult the Critters section, for the subject’s Physical attributes while in critter form. Add 1
to the critter’s Base attribute Ratings for every hit the caster generates.
Her Mental attributes remain unchanged.
this spell does not transform clothing and equipment. Magicians
in critter form can still cast spells, but cannot perform other tasks requiring speech.
Critter form works like the Shapechange spell, but only allows the
subject to change into a specific non-paranormal animal. Each critter
form is a different spell (Eagle Form, Wolf Form, and so on)

#### Turn to Goo (Physical)

- Type: P 
- Range: LOS 
- Duration: S 
- FV: (F ÷ 2) + 2

Turn to Goo transforms living tissue into a sticky, glue-like substance.
the caster must win an Opposed Test pitting her Spellcasting + Magic
against the target’s Stamina (+ Counterspelling). Additionally, the spell’s
Force must equal or exceed the target’s Stamina. Non-living material—
including clothing, gear, and cyberware—is not affected. the target
is not conscious while under the effects of this spell, and any damage
suffered by the gooey form affects the target normally. the goo has a
barrier Armor rating equal to Stamina + Effect.




## The Matrix

In the Sixth World, information is power. Nowhere is this more true than on the Matrix. It is ubiquitous, connecting everything from office workstations to home-automation systems. From bleeding-edge advanced prototypes to ten-year-old burner commlinks, the Matrix is everywhere. Technically speaking, the Matrix is the interconnection of all worldwide devices, wireless or otherwise, that use the same protocols and methods for communication. In a more abstract sense, the Matrix is a vast shared virtual space, home to the entirety of metahuman knowledge, with a fair bit of imagination and outright lies mixed in. Everyday users access the Matrix for many tasks in the course of their day, searching for trideos of cats, answering phone calls, remotely turning on their car, controlling a logging drone, or monitoring cameras, among other things.

Hackers (Deckers), on the other hand, make the Matrix do what they want, legally or otherwise. Some, called deckers after the equipment they use, do it with high-tech devices called cyberdecks.

Matrix-based devices and defenses are so common that a character competent in using or bypassing such things is integral to any runner team. Hackers earn their pay disabling alarms and auto-defenses, scrambling enemy communications, and destroying anything that connects to the Matrix. They act as the team’s communications hub, safeguarding them from virtual attack. They’re also the go-to specialists when it comes to digging out information, either in a general search or a quest for specific piece of data they can fence or ransom for cash.

### Matrix History

The Matrix, as we know it in the Sixth World, is the third iteration of what used to be called the in ternet or World Wide Web. Around the turn of the millennium, it took off and grew incredibly fast, adding new technologies for enhanced stability and speed at an almost daily rate.

Then, in 2029, things took a turn for the worse. A fast-moving and destructive virus unlike anything the world had seen began taking down large swaths of network infrastructure, destroying software and hardware alike. The United States organized an elite squad of hackers, technicians, and network wizards and equipped them with newly developed techniques for direct neural interface, then sent them against the virus. Echo Mirage, as the “cyber-commandos” were known, took heavy casualties as lethal biofeedback from the Crash Virus shocked and cooked their brains. Undeterred, they pressed on, and eventually scrubbed the Virus from the network—but the damage had been done.

The demise of the old internet and the Crash of ’29 gave rise to the Matrix, an advanced network designed to run with the human-computer interfaces used exclusively by crack teams like Echo Mirage in the past. The direct neural links that at one point required psychoactive drugs, massive amounts of cable, and a sensory-deprivation tank to use now only took a much-smaller computer and a small piece of cyberware called a datajack. The datajack was implanted directly into a user’s head, acting as a port for a cable that would connect a computer to the metahuman brain.

As time went on, virtual space grew more and more complex, and it became commonplace for workers to spend their entire day “jacked in.” Not every technological leap forward was a boon, though. Pushing the envelope on advanced, semi-autonomous programs, Renraku stumbled into creating the first artificial intelligence. Later, born from the dissection of Renraku’s creation, another AI—one hostile to metahumanity—came into being. The shockwaves caused by this AI, in addition to a perfect storm of other factors, turned out to be too much for the Matrix. The network collapsed completely in 2064, an event now known as the Second Crash (or Crash 2.0).

Out of the ashes of the old Matrix came the Matrix as we know it today. It is primarily a wireless network, and corporations have taken extensive steps to stop would-be hackers through the implementation of the Grid Overwatch Division. Yet, despite the chokehold corporations hold over the Matrix, its mysteries run deep. Some infrastructure is decades old, and unknown to even the savviest virtual crusaders. Even more strangely, some metahumans are able to access the Matrix without using any sort of equipment at all. In the corporations’ eyes, these technomancers are both a security threat and a valuable commodity as a new evolution of metahumanity.

### The Matrix in Daily Life

Using the Matrix is an everyday task for most of the Sixth World, though some immerse themselves in it, allowing their perceptions to be overridden by simsense. Either way, to make the Matrix do what you want, you must first understand what you’re looking at. If you’re interacting with the Matrix through the screen of a commlink held in your hand, what you see will look vastly different than if you were using augmented reality (AR) or virtual reality (VR). This is the most rudimentary use of the Matrix, allowing for things such as commcalls, messaging, and use of basic media, including music and games. When using a commlink, various programs can help you navigate from place to place through voice or touch commands. Through these, you can access various hosts and interface with augmented-reality objects (AROs) nearby, allowing them to appear as a sort of pop-up window on the commlink screen.

When you enter augmented reality, whether you use an implanted image link, AR-capable glasses, a datajack, or a technomancer’s innate perception, your perspective on the world around you will change dramatically. The “real world” still exists, but virtual icons interact and overlap with it. A mechanic might use an AR display to provide a digital outline and manual for an engine to assist them with repairs. Entering a posh new restaurant, you may be greeted with a wine list and a menu, along with the day’s specials, hovering alongside you as you walk. An old warehouse can be turned into a vibrant dance club with bright icons and swirling glitter that have no physical substance.

Using AR is essentially dipping a toe into the greater virtual reality of the Matrix. You can see the Matrix sprawling out around you, but real-life rules still apply. Your speed in AR is limited by how fast your body can move, and you can only see as far as you normally could, making the abstract infinity of the Matrix seem impossibly far away at times. Even so, this small dip into the Matrix can greatly alter the world around you, as advertisements, virtual overlays, and the myriad of wireless devices provide stark contrast with reality’s frequent dullness.

To take things a step further, you’ll have to immerse yourself in full virtual reality. In VR, the perceptions of the real world fall away; your consciousness is subsumed into the Matrix, and your senses are overridden by the ASIST (Artificial Sensory Induction Systems Technology) interface, more commonly known as simsense. Before you stretches an infinite black horizon, dotted with brightly colored images. 

These icons represent anything that can be interacted with in the Matrix. In their default mode, an icon appears as a featureless white sphere—but seeing such an icon is a rarity, thanks to the amount of customization available. Icons for parked cars look like virtual representations of what they are, and icons for individual personal area networks (PANs) are often represented by animated characters, or hyper-realistic versions of their owner’s subjective view of perfection. Ultimately, an icon can appear in whatever way the owner chooses, with the higher-end icons being incredibly detailed and sculpted. Beyond individual PANs, huge icons loom over the virtual horizon, representing those with the most power over the Matrix, the corporations that make it run. These monumental icons are the public gateways to the individual hosts of those corporations, replete with propaganda extolling the virtues of the company in glowing corporate-speak—and sometimes, coupons!

Icons whose hosts are closest to your meat body appear closer, with physically far-away hosts seeming out of sight of your virtual perceptions. Of course, physics is just a suggestion within the Matrix, and traveling these distances in the blink of an eye is as simple as willing yourself to your destination. Still other icons and access points exist, so that people across the globe can log on whever they want.

For all of the official control, though, there are corners of the Matrix that are still unknown. Whether these are the result of older corporate networks hanging on as part of the new Matrix, the expansion of artificial intelligence, or the manifestation of the mysterious source of power that technomancers call the Resonance is yet to be revealed.

### Matrix Security: Grid Overwatch Division

In the wake of the Second Crash in 2064, the new Matrix that was born from the ashes of the old one gave rise to widespread wireless technology. No longer did users have to use a cable to jack into the Matrix—now, they could wirelessly connect from anywhere they could receive a signal. The network had become such a reliable mesh that roaming between grids became the norm. A hacker could conceivably never leave their home and still interact with (and break into) any number of devices and hosts around the world, using only their commlink.

That all changed in the mid-2070s, when the Corporate Court Matrix Authority created the Grid Overwatch Division, or GOD. Initially, this organization comprised representatives of the Big Ten megacorporations who propped up the Matrix after the Crash, and it was tasked with keeping an eye on the emergence of artificial intelligences. Their authority was soon expanded to make them a watchdog group responsible for tracking down illegal use of the Matrix—and to help define what was and was not legal. This practice was adopted individually by other corporations, who formed their own internal groups, colloquially known as demi-GODs.

With the increase in GOD’s power, the Wild West era of the new Matrix was all but over. Still, there are those who know how to fly under the radar, at least for little while, before they are caught.


### Personas and Attributes

Personas are the “people” of the Matrix. They’re primarily metahumans, but personas can also be programs, agents, intrusion countermeasures (IC or “ice”), and (rarely) artificial intelligences. Just like living beings in the meat world, personas have attributes and skills that determine how well they function. The skills you have in the meat world carry over to the Matrix, though they are not always useful (your persona may look like it’s firing a gun, but the Firearms skill is of little use in the Matrix— what looks like an attack is an action covered by another skill; see Matrix Actions).

Attributes are somewhat different. Your Mental attributes carry over into the Matrix, but your Physical attributes are replaced by four Matrix attributes: Attack, Sleaze, Data Processing, and Firewall (ASDF).

Attack represents the offensive power of the
device in cybercombat and how much damage
it can do when attacking.

- Sleaze is the stealth attribute of the persona and represents how easy it is to hide and blend in with its surroundings, appearing as a normal icon among others, essentially disappearing.

- Data Processing is the raw computing power of a device. Data Processing governs how quickly a device can operate and contributes to running programs concurrently. 

- Firewall is a persona’s primary defensive attribute. It represents how well-defended the persona is against attempts to take unauthorized actions.

If you’re a decker, your Matrix attributes are determined by the device you’re using to access the Matrix. If the device doesn’t possess one or more of the Matrix attributes, then the applicable attribute is treated as if it were 0. You can rotate any non-zero attributes through your persona, even if they originated from different devices. 

Devices also have a Matrix Condition Monitor, which is equal to `(Device Rating / 2, rounded up) + 8`. 

All tests using a damaged device have a –1 modifier for every three full boxes of Matrix damage, until the device is repaired. If a device’s Matrix Condition Monitor is filled up, it is bricked (see Bricked Devices, below).

### Bricked Devices

A bricked device is one whose formerly complex functioning has been reduced to that of a slab of nonfunctional material. That is to say, it doesn’t work, plain and simple, since its Condition Monitor has been filled. For the most part, meat-world observers of a bricked device can tell when something goes wrong—sparks, popping noises, and smoke are clear indicators of a problem. Users of a bricked device are abruptly ejected from the Matrix, and VR users have to deal with dumpshock. The device will not work again until it is repaired.

### Repairing Matrix Damage


What’s broken can often be fixed, with the proper tools, time, and talent. Repairing a damaged device is an `Engineering + Logic (number of boxes, 1 hour Extended test`. 

The device cannot be used while it is being repaired, and repairs cannot be performed without a toolkit. A critical glitch on a repair test means you messed up good—the device fails totally and will never work again.

### Overwatch Score and Convergence

When hacking, note the number of Effect scored by the defender. This is not net effect, but all effect scored in the test. This total becomes the Overwatch Score (OS). When the OS reaches 40, Convergence occurs.

Convergence is GOD zeroing in on your location. When this occurs, the device used to perform the last hacking test is bricked (its Condition Monitor is filled), and the user is dumped from the Matrix, with associated dumpshock. Additionally, the user’s physical location is reported to the authorities so they might send people to track you down.

Things that increase the Overwatch Score are as follows:

- Using hacking programs: OS increases by 1 for each Matrix action modified by a hacking program. Simply having the program loaded without actively using it doesn’t increase your OS.)

- Performing hacking actions (as noted above): +1 OS per effect on the opposing roll, whether the defense was successful or not.

- Every round you are connected to a Device or Sytem you are not supposed to the OS will go up 1 unless you make your Detection Test

- During Cybercombat your OS goes up 1 automatically every round without a Detection Test allowed.


### Dumpshock and Link-Locking

When you’re disconnected from the Matrix while in VR without gracefully switching to AR first, you suffer a nasty shock as your sim module kicks out. This happens to hackers so often that it has its own name: dumpshock. The Damage Value for dumpshock is 3S if you’re in cold-sim and 3P if you’re in hot-sim. Dumpshock is biofeedback damage, so you resist it with Willpower. As if that weren’t enough, you’re also disoriented and so cannot gain Bonus Effect or use Edge on actions for (10 – Willpower) minutes, even if you manage to soak all the damage.

Another danger in the Matrix is having your connection link-locked. This is when another persona or device sends keep-alive signals to your deck (or other device) that force it to cancel any attempt to leave the Matrix. If you’re link-locked, you can’t use the Enter/Exit Host, Reboot Device, or Switch Interface Mode actions on the device your persona is using (probably your deck). You can escape with a successful Jack Out action. Successfully jacking out usually means suffering dumpshock, but at least you’re free. Any persona, be they agent, technomancer, or sprite, can be link-locked.

Usually, if you fall unconscious in VR, your commlink or deck automatically switches you to AR. If you’re link-locked, you remain online and in VR, which can be quite dangerous. IC may attack an unconscious decker, and security spiders, being a bit smarter than IC and no less ruthless, have a lot of options to punish someone who is helpless and stuck in the Matrix. Either way, it’s nasty, since you can’t defend against actions when you’re unconscious.

### Noise

Noise represents any interference between a user and their target. Noise can be created by sheer distance or other factors, such as jamming or obstructions. Each point of noise incurs a –1 penalty to any test taken in the Matrix. If noise is greater than the device rating, the device cannot access the Matrix or provide wireless bonuses.


| PHYSICAL DISTANCE TO TARGET/OBSTACLES        | NOISE LEVEL                         |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Directly connected (any distance)            | 0                                   |
| Up to 100 yards                              | 0                                   |
| 100–1,000 yards                              | 1                                   |
| 1,001–10,000 yards (10k yds )                | 3                                   |
| 10,001 yards to 100k yds                     | 5                                   |
| Greater than 100k yds                        | 8                                   |
| Dense foliage                                | 1 per 5 yards                       |

### Cyberjacks

Cyberjacks are a fairly invasive piece of gear, implanted deep into the brain, and meant to interface more smoothly with a cyberdeck. While they can act as a simple datajack, they also perform the function of integrating the ASIST interface more directly, thus providing superior speed and response times.

They represent the Data Processing and Firewall attributes

### Hacking the Matrix

To Hack into the Matrix first you need to gain access to a Device or System. You have two options (technically three) to do this.

1. The best and easiest way in, is a Hardline access through the building. You need a user and credentials otherwise you still need options 2 or 3
2. Probe your way in using Sleaze. You try to work your way in through gaps in the security you make Detection Tests each round. 
3. Brute Force your way in. This is the noisy way in. You attack the Device/Network/System Node directly. This will trigger any IC that Device has

### Systems and Devices

Whats the difference?

#### Devices

A Device is a physical electronic or mechanical object with a function or purpose, such as a commlink, smartgun, sensor, or even an appliance. Devices have an associated Device Rating, can be integrated into a mesh network, and can be wirelessly accessed or controlled through the Matrix. Hacking a device is generally done against the Device Rating (where Hosts use their Host Rating)

#### Hosts
Hosts have a general rating, which translates into their Matrix attributes. These general ratings are between 1 and 12. The ratings of these attributes are usually (host rating), (host rating + 1), (host rating + 2), and (host rating + 3), in any order. For example, a rating 4 host might have Attack 5, Sleaze 4, Data Processing 7, Firewall 6. A host’s attributes are shared by itself and its IC programs.

Host Attack Rating: Host Rating X 2

Condition Monitor: 

Initiative: (Data Processing x 2) + 3D6

- Rating 1: Personal sites, public education.
- Rating 2–3: Low-end commercial businesses, social media.
- Rating 4–5: Local and regional corporate sites, major governments.
- Rating 6+: Megacorporate headquarters, military command

Systems are really just a collection of Nodes. There are many different kinds of Nodes but the ones you care about are:

- Central Processing Unit (CPU)Each system has one, and only one, CPU. It's the brain of the system, so it's naturally the most heavily guarded
  - Allows you to Crash the System if you get access, you can completely take over the System and all Devices attach to it. Raises OS 5 a round.
- Datastores (DS) where information is stored its Rating is also the Encryption Rating (usually)
- Input Output Port (IOP) these are hardline points inside a building or system. Devices like Cameras are attached to IOP's so is every terminal.
- System Access Node (SAN) these are generally public access points with lower security, a typical access point for a Decker

### Types of IC

These are the types of IC a host may throw at unwary intruders. All IC use Host Attack Rating and (Host Rating x 2) for Condition Monitor and most rolls. Their Initiative is (Data Processing x 2) + 3D6. Defensive rolls and effects vary by IC type.

Trust me, the GM knows exactly what kind of IC you are up against.

#### Acid
- Defense: Host Rating + Firewall

Acid IC is about wearing down the defenses of intruders so that the other IC can finish it off. When Acid IC hits in cybercombat, the target’s Firewall attribute is reduced by 1 per net hit, reducing the effective defenses. Lost points are restored after leaving the host, at a rate of 1 point per minute.

#### Binder
- Defense: Firewall + Data Processing

Where Acid IC wants to reduce your defenses, Binder IC wants to slow down all of your functionality— and keep you from running as many programs as you would like. When Binder IC hits in cybercombat, the target’s Data Processing attribute is reduced by 1 per net Effect. When Data Processing hits 0, no Matrix actions can be performed until it hits 1 or higher. Lost points are restored after leaving the host, at a rate of 1 point per minute.

#### Black IC
- Defense: Host Rating + Firewall

Black IC means business. When a host tosses this out, it wants your brain fried, plain and simple. If you see this coming at you, no one would blame you for running. In cybercombat, Black IC does (host rating + net effect) in both Matrix damage and biofeedback damage.

#### Blaster
- Defense: Host Rating + Firewall

Blaster IC isn’t fun, but at least it’s not as focused on killing you as Black IC is. Yeah, it might want to subject you to all sorts of unpleasant Matrix- based torture, but you have to be alive to experience pain, so that’s something, right? In cybercombat, this does (Rating) Matrix damage while also link-locking the target.

#### Crash
- Defense: Host Rating + Firewall

Crash delivers a sweeping blow intended to take weapons out of your hand. When it hits in cybercombat, this IC does no Matrix damage; instead, it crashes one random program. Crashed programs can’t be run again until the device is rebooted.

#### Jammer
- Defense: Firewall + Attack

Jammer IC is an expert fencer who toys with you rather than killing you outright. In cybercombat, when Jammer IC hits, the target’s Attack attribute is reduced by 1 per net effect. No actions using the Attack rating can be performed when the Attack rating is 0. Lost points are restored after leaving the host, at a rate of 1 point per minute.

#### Killer
- Defense: Host Rating + Firewall

Killer IC is the choice of hosts where they don’t want to go for a bunch of fancy tactics and prefer to just leap for the jugular. When Killer IC hits in cybercombat, it does (net hits + host rating) Matrix damage to the target.

#### Marker
- Defense: Firewall + Sleaze

Marker IC is a response to too many backdoors— if hackers are going to start preferring Sleaze options to make and secure backdoors into hosts, then hosts are going to keep hackers from having high Sleaze ratings. In cybercombat, when Marker IC hits, the target’s Sleaze attribute is reduced by 1 per net hit. No actions using the Sleaze rating can be performed when the Sleaze rating is 0. Lost points are restored after leaving the host, at a rate of 1 point/minute.

#### Scramble
- Defense: Host Rating + Firewall

Scramble IC doesn’t care how hurt or damaged you are; it just wants you gone. If Scramble IC hits in cybercombat, it forces the target to reboot on the target’s next turn, unless the target is linklocked.

#### Sparky
- Defense: Host Rating + Firewall

Sparky is aggressive IC that wants to bring the damage right to the user, bypassing hardware entirely. If Sparky IC hits in cybercombat, it does (host rating + net hits) in biofeedback damage.

#### Tar Baby
- Defense: Host Rating + Firewall

Tar Baby is about slowing you down so you can be caught by other IC or you abandon the host in frustration. If Tar Baby hits in cybercombat, it forces link-lock.

#### Track
- Defense: Firewall + Sleaze

Track IC doesn’t do harm directly—it’s about gathering information in case harm needs to be done later. If it hits in cybercombat, Track IC discovers the target’s physical location.

### Regular Matrix Actions
These are used outside Cybercombat. You take 1 action a round.

#### **Brute Force**

Getting access the loud way.

This is an obvious attack and will trigger an alert. Your OS *will* go up using Attacks. This is used to get into a System. Using Brute Force will trigger Any IC if there is any

`Cracking + Logic` vs. `Rating + Firewall` DV = (Attack + Effect) Reduce Damage by Firewall

If attacked by a Host, IC, or Device they roll `Rating + Attack` against your `Cracking + Logic` and you will reduce damage by your Firewall. Damage will be applied to your Cyber Deck

#### **Probe**

Getting Access the Quiet Way.

Used to sneak into systems and not trigger an alert. As long as you are undetected (see Detection Tests) your OS will not go up. This requires a Detection Test.

`Cracking + Logic` vs. `Rating + Firewall` Sleaze + Effect applies to Detection Test

#### **Matrix Search**

Search the publicly accessible grid for information. The number of effect generated gives you more information regarding the subject.

`Cracking + Logic` vs. `Sleaze + Firewall`

#### **Encrypt/Decrypt File**

Decrypts a file or Encrypts a file on the Host. Usually used after a Matrix Search. This requires a Detection Test.

`Cracking + Logic vs. Encryption Rating` Effect + Data Processing will weaken Encryption.

`Cracking + Logic` to set Encryption Strength with Effect + Data Processing.

#### **Snoop**

This action lets you intercept Matrix traffic sent to and from your target for as long as you have access. You can listen to, view, or read this data live, or you can save it for later playback/viewing if you have something to store it on (your deck or commlink will do). This requires a Detection Test.

`Cracking + Logic vs. Rating + Firewall` Effect + Data Processing applies to Detection Roll


#### **Control Device**

You take control of a device (like a camera). You own it as long as you control it. This is an obvious action and will raise your OS in the System. You can control 1 device per Data Processing of your Deck.

`Cracking + Logic vs. Rating + Firewall` Effect + Data Processing for how long you will control the device.

#### Analyze

This allows you to Analyze a Node or Device you are wanting information about. Analyze will tell you on a success the Rating, if it has IC. Each Net Effect can tell you a piece of information. This requires a Detection Test.

`Electronics + Intuition vs Device Sleaze + Firewall` Sleaze + Effect will tell you a piece of Information.

#### **Jack Out**

This logs you out and resets your Deck immediately. You will have Dumpshock if you do this during Cybercombat.

#### Check OS Score

Does not require a roll will tell you what your Current OS score is. This requires a Detection Test.

### Detection Rolls

This works a lot a like resisting, Drain does for an Awakened Character. You need to roll to avoid Detection if you fail your OS goes up. Any action you take (except Attack because it guarantees OS will go up) you roll to avoid Detection.

`Cracking + Logic` vs. `Rating + your current OS` failure means you take the Net Effect to your OS

Once OS reaches 40 they are detected and Dumped out of the Matrix and their Deck is Bricked. 

### Programs
Your Cyberdeck can hold a number of programs up to its Capacity.
