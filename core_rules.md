## What is Sixfinity?

SIRE is a (Potential XD6) TTRPG system created by CJ Schrum to be a generic system used to play any kind of TTRPG. It was influenced by his near thirty years of table top games in nearly every ruleset created. 


## Shadowrun Setting

What better challenge for a generic TTRPG system than to convert one of the more crunchy games that was ever created? EFFECT was added to the game specifically to accomplish the Shadowrun feel. It is not in the core Sixfinity experience.

### Statistics (STATIS)

There are six STATIS and 2 special STATIS.

> Essence was added for Shadowrun

---

**S.T.A.T.I.S**

---


**Stamina**

This represents the general strength, sturdiness, integrity, and health of the individual. It sometimes is correlated to size—trolls tend to have high Stamina ratings— but this is not a perfect correlation, as dwarfs tend to have higher Stamina ratings than humans. Stamina’s uses include resisting damage and toxins.

**Talent**

Talent represents a character’s memorizing ability and raw brain power. It denotes how fast a character learns, how much she can re- member, and how well she can execute pre-planned sequences. A Talent-lacking character might get overwhelmed when confronted with a lot of details and may have a poor memory—especially for facts and figures. Characters with a high Talent rating will likely be excellent book-learners, able to deal with computer and magic theory with ease, and capable of building (and tearing down!) machinery and electronics. 

**Agility**

Agility represents fine motor control—manual Agility, flexibility, balance, and coordination. A character with a low Agility may be someone with an inner-ear problem, one leg that is shorter than the other, or a simple klutz. Higher Agility ratings may belong to charac- ters that are “natural” athletes.

**Tenacity**

Tenacity keeps a character going when she wants to give up, or enables her to control her habits and emotions. Tenacity determines whether or not a character is going to take charge of her life. A character with low Tenacity might defer to other people when big decisions are being made, for example. A high-Tenacity character is more assured and possesses a never-say-die streak. Such characters go down to the monowire because that’s exactly the fragging point. Tenacity also represents a character’s cool under fire, her ability to resist intimida- tion and manipulation, and her resolve to stick to her guns when the pressure is on.

**Intuition**

Intuition is your gut instinct, your sudden inspiration, your flash of insight that doesn’t seem to make any sense but still works. Intuition helps characters react to danger, perceive threats, and resist some magic threats. 

**Savvy**

Savvy is a nebulous STATIS. More than just looks, Savvy represents a character’s personal aura, self-image, ego, willingness to find out what people want and give it to them, and ability to recognize what she can and can’t get out of people. A whiny demeanor, a me-first attitude, or an inability to read Stamina language or subtle hints are just a few traits that can give a character low Savvy. A character with high Savvy might simply enjoy entertaining others, may excel at making friends and/or manipulating people, or may be all flash and fun with whomever it is today. A high-Savvy character might deliver jokes at the right moment, have a sexy way of carrying herself, or com- mand respect because her timing is always impeccable.

---

**Special**

Please note Resonance is not used in Sixfinity if it is referenced ignore it.

**Magic**

Not all characters have this STATIS; it is only for magic-using characters, who are generally referred to as Awakened characters. It measures their Stamina in channeling mana into spectacular effects.

**Essence**

All characters have this STATIS, starting at 6. It is a measure of how many augmentations characters can hold. The metahuman Stamina can only contain so much ’ware before it loses the small spark that separates a living being from a machine. This STATIS primarily exists due to the degrees of difference between biology and technology—it simply does not flow well through technology and becomes limited as your Essence declines (specifically, anytime your Essence goes below any whole integer, you lose a corresponding point of Magic or Resonance). Also, some magic, particularly healing magic, has less of an effect on you as you gain more augmentations. Finally, if your Essence ever reaches 0, you die

#### Step 1: Background
Create your characrers background. Who are they, where did they come from? How did they get here?

Pick your Concept.

Define your Trouble, Flaw or Obligation.

Write two aspects.

#### Step 2: Pick a Metatype

#### Step 3: Pick an Archtype
Think of Archtype like what you do it guides your Archtype skills, skills that you have the most familiarity with. Think of it like your role in the group.

#### Step 4: Pick Starting Skills
Pick 3 Skills at Rank 1 for no Experience Cost. 

#### Step 5: Invest Experience

**Starting XP**

Experience points are what you use to customize your character and make them truly unique. During this step, you can spend all of your character’s experience points on improving STATIS, purchasing talents, and buying ranks in skills. If you don’t spend all of your character’s experience, that’s fine; you’ll save all the unspent experience points and can spend them at the end of any session during the game. However, keep in mind that your character is going to be earning more experience points during the course of their adventures, so you’ll have more experience to spend in the future.

You may spend experience points in the following ways to improve your character.

**Improving Characteristics**

During character creation, raising a characteristic to the next highest rating costs ten times the value it is being raised to. 

For example, raising your character’s Stamina from 3 to 4 would require 40 experience points. You must purchase each improvement sequentially. This means that raising your character’s Stamina from 3 to 5 would cost 90 experience points: 40 for raising it from 3 to 4, then 50 more for raising it from 4 to 5. No characteristic can be increased higher than 5, either in character creation or in gameplay. However, this limit only applies to player characters. In addition, any character may get access to equipment or special powers that temporarily raise one or more of their STATIS higher than 5. However, your character’s base STATIS still max out at 5.

Characteristics may only be purchased with experience points during character creation, not at any later time. During gameplay, however, STATIS can be increased by purchasing specific talents. This means you should plan on spending most (if not all) of your start-
ing XP on improving your character’s STATIS.

**Skill Training**

The various skills your character can purchase depend
on what setting you’re playing in. Skills Chapter, lists all skills.

Each skill has five ranks of training available. Your character already has ranks in various skills. At this stage, your character may purchase more ranks in skills using their starting XP. However, regardless of any character creation options, your character cannot have any skills higher than rank 2 once character creation is finished, unless a rule specifically states otherwise.

Buying a rank in a Archtype skill follows a cost structure similar to that for buying a rating in a characteristic; training a skill to the next highest rank costs five times the rank to which it is being raised. For example, training a skill from rank 0 (untrained) to rank 1 requires 5 experience points. Improving a rank 1 skill to rank 2 requires 10 experience points. Each rank must be purchased sequentially. 

This means that acquiring a rank 2 Archtype skill during character creation costs 15 experience points (5 for raising it from zero to rank 1, then 10 more for raising it from rank 1 to rank 2).

Buying a rank in a non-Archtype skill works mostly the same way, but costs a bit more. Each rank of a non-Archtype skill costs five times the rank you’re purchasing, plus 5 additional experience points. So, raising a non-Archtype skill to rank 1 costs 10 XP, while raising it from rank 1 to rank 2 costs 15 XP. As with Archtype skills, each rank must be purchased sequentially. You may purchase ranks in skills for your character during character creation or later during gameplay.

You probably want to buy a couple of ranks of various skills now, but you can spend most of your XP on STATIS and wait to buy more skills with the XP your character earns as the game progresses.

**Acquiring Talents**

Talents are something any character can purchase. Like skills, the talents available to your character depend on what setting you’re playing in. Talents Chapter, lists the talents available in all settings and some specific to individual settings. So, as with skills, before you build your character, make sure your GM has decided on a setting and what talents to allow.

Purchasing talents is covered in greater detail in the Talents Chapter. Talents are organized into tiers, with each talent costing five XP times its tier level. So, Tier 1 talents cost 5 XP, but Tier 5 talents cost 25 XP. You can buy as many Tier 1 talents for your character as you like, but if you want to purchase talents in higher tiers, you have to follow this simple rule: after buying a talent in a tier, you must ensure your character has more talents in the tier directly below it.

Characters may purchase talents during character creation or later during gameplay. Even more so than with skills, you probably want to spend sparingly on talents during character creation. You’ll have plenty of chances to buy talents once the game begins.

**Languages**

Your character starts with one native language. You may purchase additional languages for 5 XP. Please refer to Shadowrun source materials for lists of languages to use in your campaign. This can be purchased multiple times, one for each language, and is available during and after character creation.

All languages that exist in today’s world persist in 2080, along with the following newer languages:
- Or’zet: Language of the Orks, recovered from time by the dragon Dunkelzahn in 2057. This has been adopted heavily by orks, who have added many modern loan words from Cityspeak.
- Perkins-Athabaskan: A sign language used by North American Sasquatches.
- Sperethiel: Language of the Elves, spoken as an official language in Elvish lands such as Tír na nÓg and Tír Tairngire. Sperethiel is described as a very complex language with a number of subtle variations enabling expressions of different levels of formality and rank between speakers, much as in Japanese.
- Upvehu: A language reminiscent of Gaelic that is used primarily by Pixies.

#### Step 6: Determine Derived Attrbiutes

##### Defense
Defense represents an extra level of protection that makes your character harder to hit in combat. Defense is divided into ranged defense and melee defense. Your character’s default value for each defense rating is 0. Defense is most commonly gained by wearing armor or by adopting a defensive position in combat (such as gaining cover). Some talents may also increase one or both of your character’s defense ratings.

Besides using certain types of gear, there is no easy way for your character to have a starting melee or ranged defense higher than 0. So, if your character doesn’t have any defense, don’t worry! You didn’t do anything wrong. Your character has another type of protection, called soak.

Defense gives the attacker DISADVANTAGE per point (up to the maximum of 4) to hit you.

##### Soak Value 
Soak value determines how much incoming damage a character can shrug off before being seriously wounded. A character's soak value is subtracted from any incoming damage. Any remaining damage after subtracting soak becomes wounds, and is applied towards the character's wound threshold. A character's default soak value is equal to his Stamina rating. After determining this initial value, increases to a character's Stamina rating increase his soak value. Additional soak value is most often gained by wearing armor. Later increases to Stamina rating also increase soak. 

##### Wounds
Your character’s wound threshold represents, basically, how many wounds—how much physical damage—a character can withstand before becoming incapacitated. Your character’s starting wound threshold is determined by adding the wound threshold for their archetype or species to their Stamina rating (after spending starting XP). After you determine this initial value, further increases to your character’s Stamina rating **do not increase their wound threshold—wound threshold improvements are acquired by purchasing talents, such as Toughened.**

- 15-18 is pretty tough
- 11-14 is about Averag
- 10 or lower you should be careful in combat

Wounds = 10 + Stamina Score

##### Strain
Your character’s strain threshold determines how much strain—psychological and mental damage—a character can withstand before becoming stunned, dazed, or incapacitated. Your character’s starting strain threshold is determined by adding the strain threshold for their archetype or species to their Tenacity rating (after spending starting XP). After you determine this initial value, further increases to your character’s Tenacity rating **do not increase their strain threshold—strain threshold improvements are acquired by purchasing appropriate talents, such as Grit**.

- 13-16 is pretty tough
- 10-12 is about average
- Less than 10 you should avoid taking strain damage

Strain = 10 + Tenacity Score

##### Edge Pool
Edge is covered in greater detail in the Rules Chapter but it is your characters luck, a small currency you can use to add a D6 to your rolls when needed. 

Edge Pool = [((Agility + Talent + Tenacity)) / 2] Round up

So if you had a Agility of 3, Talent of 2, and Tenacity of 3, you would have a Edge Pool of 4


### Character Advancement

In this game you spend your experience you gain at the end of the sessions to increase your charatcer during downtimes. 

| Desired EFFECT              | XP Cost                                         |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |

| Raise an Archtype skill     | New Rating X 5                                  |
| Purchase Non-Archtype Skill | New Rating X 5 + 5                              |
| Purchase Language           | 5                                               |
| New Spell                   | 5                                               |
| New Talent                  | Rating * 5                                      |

## Chapter 2: Metatype
// Locked for Playtest

### Humans (homo sapiens sapiens)
- S: 2, T: 2, A: 2, T: 2, I: 2, S: 2
- Starting Wound Threshold: 10 + Stamina
- Starting Strain Threshold: 10 + Tenacity
- Starting Experience: 110
- Starting Skills: Start with one rank in each of two different skills.

As the majority of the sentient beings of the world, humans create existing definitions of “normal,” and then some of them set out to abuse those definitions as hard as they can. These humans know that they lack the pure physical Stamina and social cohesion of some of the other metatypes, so they shape the world in a way that keeps the individuals they don’t like from ever realizing what they can do, and what they can become. The side effect of this, of course, is that many humans are caught up in the demoralizing machinery that the ruling corporate class has assembled, because they don’t fit into this artificial average. They are grist for the mill, people to be chewed up and spat out in the name of greater wealth and power for the people at the top. Because they’re humans, and there are so many of them, who’s going to notice how they’re ground down, and who is going to miss them when they’re gone? The shadows are full of humans who could not find a way to be normal or average.


### Elves (homo sapiens nobilis)
- S: 1, T: 2, A: 2, T: 2, I: 2, S: 3
- Starting Wound Threshold: 10 + Stamina
- Starting Strain Threshold: 11 + Tenacity
- Starting Experience: 95
- Starting Skills: Start with one rank in Etiquette and Coordination.
- Low-light Vision: Remove 2 DISADVANTAGE from any check incurred by dim light.

Perhaps the most infuriating thing about elves to the other metatypes is that you can resent them like hell, and they just won’t care. They have two prosperous nations—Tír na nÓg (formerly known as Ireland) and Tír Tairngire (in the western part of North America)—they have people in some of the most powerful positions in the world, and celebrities whose MeFeed hits are in the billions. They are envied, not looked down on. But plenty of elves know that this envy does not extend to every elf. If you’re an elf who is not rich, elegant, or graceful, you’re often viewed as a failure, someone who had all the gifts of life handed to them and somehow screwed them up. And it’s not just nonelves who hold this view. Never mind that you might have grown up poor, never mind what obstacles you had to face—people think you automatically had it easy because you’re an elf. But elf society is not easy to survive. The upper crust can be absolutely ruthless about enforcing their status quo, labeling those who don’t fit as malcontents and finding ways to cast them aside. The barrens of the major sprawls of the world have plenty of elves who were thrown out because they wouldn’t cave to what society wanted them to be. Their anger could burn the whole earth.

### Dwarfs (homo sapiens pumilionis)
- S: 3, T: 2, A: 1, T: 3, I: 2, S: 2
- Starting Wound Threshold: 11 + Stamina
- Starting Strain Threshold: 10 + Tenacity
- Starting Experience: 100
- Starting Skills: Start with one rank in Resilience.
- Thermographic Vision: Remove 2 DISADVANTAGE from any check incurred by dim or no light.
- Sturdy: Add +1 Proficiency to any Resilience check involving resisting a poison or toxin.

Sixth World dwarfs are often accepted into mainstream society without being fully valued. The taller metatypes seem to be happiest when dwarfs fit the roles they have preconceived for them— sidekicks, drivers, mechanics, that sort of thing. It doesn’t help that their size helps them squeeze into vehicles that orks, humans, and elves might have difficulty with, ones that trolls couldn’t even consider using. Still, they get work and little direct hate. They’re treated nicely, but they can’t help but feel that they’re being, well, overlooked. Dwarfs across the globe are dedicated to showing that they cannot be ignored. Dwarf deckers, street samurai, covert ops specialists, faces, and more are popping up in the international shadows, and others underestimate them at their peril. The lack of heightened antipathy against dwarfs helped them assimilate in human communities better than other metatypes. This means that they do not have as many of their own enclaves as some of the other metatypes (it also doesn’t help that they don’t have access to whatever stream of revenue the elves tap into build their kingdoms). With the founding of the dwarf-centric Biloxi Technical Institute, southern Mississippi in the CAS is becoming a dwarf haven. What that will grow into and how that will shape the world is anyone’s guess.


### Orks (homo sapiens robustus)
- S: 3, T: 2, A: 2, T: 2, I: 2, S: 1
- Starting Wound Threshold: 12 + Stamina
- Starting Strain Threshold: 9 + Tenacity
- Starting Experience: 100
- Starting Skills: Start with one rank in Streetwise.
- Low-light Vision: Remove 2 DISADVANTAGE from any check incurred by dim light.
- Tough as Nails: Once per session, change the result of the dice rolled for a Critical Injury on you to 01.

Orks make people nervous, and people don’t like to be nervous. Their tusks, bone structure, and pointed ears mark them as something altogether else, and their Stamina and size clearly show the damage they could do. As humans have done for centuries, they address the thing they fear by pushing them aside, keeping orks from building collective Stamina, and crushing them with the sheer force of numbers. That approach works as long as you can keep fear stoked and have it immobilize the masses. Because if people can move past the fear and start to understand the deliberate injustice that has been forced on some groups, they separate themselves from society’s machine, and the number of people used to enforce oppression gets smaller. Oppressors aren’t especially good at developing new solutions to such problems— they usually just resort to oppressing harder. So while realization of the injustices they deal with is spreading, orks across the Sixth World are preparing for things to get worse so that they can survive and set about the work of making things better. They already have some enclaves carved out for themselves— Seattle’s Underground, Atlanta’s Sweetwater Creek, Dharavi in the Indian Union—and they hope those locales will be the starting points for societies that include orks instead of fearing them.


### Trolls (homo sapiens ingentis)
- S: 4, T: 2, A: 1, T: 2, I: 2, S: 1
- Starting Wound Threshold: 14 + Stamina
- Starting Strain Threshold: 8 + Tenacity
- Starting Experience: 75
- Starting Skills: Start with one rank in Athletics.
- Thermographic Vision: Remove 2 DISADVANTAGE from any check incurred by dim or no light.
- Dermal Deposits: Increase Soak value by 1.

It’s not easy to live in a society where you look like the walking embodiment of everyone else’s nightmares. Being two to three times as large as everyone else doesn’t help much, either. It’s not a troll’s world, and most of the other residents of the world aren’t inclined to change that fact. Who wants to make space for imposing monsters? Trolls are going to have to force their way into a place in the world—of course, when they force their way in anywhere, they’re inevitably called vandals and destroyers. A significant number of trolls have looked at the way the deck is stacked against them and decided they don’t need to play the rest of the world’s game anymore. They’ll stand aside and watch the world burn—and maybe throw on an extra match every now and then. The Black Forest Troll Republic is one of the most important troll communities in the world, acting as a beacon and vision for what troll society can be while keeping a certain distance from everyone else. Whether they assimilate or build a higher wall is an open question. Trolls have the most difficult time adapting to other metatypes because their bodies are so different. It’s more than just the size and the horns— they have dermal deposits all over their bodies that make knobs, bumps, and other formations. They scrape up furniture and clothing, and make some people think twice about giving a troll a big bear hug. Especially since there are few people who can wrap their arms around a whole troll.


## Chapter 3: Archtype

Your character’s Archtype is both their narrative role within the setting and their mechanical role within the party. You choose one Archtype for your character, and you cannot switch Archtypes later on in the game.

Archtypes don’t rigidly define what your character does, however. They simply make it easier to advance into some skills and harder to advance into others. They also help define characters when they start out, making starting characters more interesting to play.

The Sixfinity character creation system mostly lets you build your characters free-form, and it lets you define your characters’ roles in the game by the choices you make. However, many players prefer a little structure and definition for their characters. For that, we have Archtypes.

You can think of a Archtype as your character’s job or role. It’s a broad concept of what your character is going to be especially good at during the game. Careers enable your character to focus on being better at certain tasks at the expense of others. 

A Archtype is usually defined by the role the character plays in the game, although we do have some Archtypes that may be thematically linked to some element of your game’s setting.

**Starting with Ranks in Career Skills**

Not only are Archtype skills cheaper for your character to purchase, but they also let your character start with some ranks in them. We did this to guarantee that your starting character has training in a few skills when the game begins. Plus, it helps direct your character toward the Archtype focus you chose.

After you select a Archtype, choose four of its eight Archtype skills. Your character starts the game with one rank in each of those four skills, without spending XP.

## Chapter 3: Talents

Talents generally represent specialized techniques that a character has mastered, typically through intense practice and study. A character is likely to be more successful when engaged in actions for which they have appropriate skills and talents. 

Generally, skills are what your character uses to perform a task. If your character wants to climb a wall, they use the Athletics skill. Talents, on the other hand, modify how a character uses that skill (such as rerolling a failed Athletics skill check when attempting) to climb that wall. Talents may also modify some of your character's other attributes (such as changing their wound threshold), or perform actions normally not allowed by the rules (such as ignoring Critical Injuries). 

To get a talent, you spend some of your experience points on it. Each talent has an experience point cost based on how powerful the talent is (more on that in a minute).

### Talent Types

There are many different types of talents. Some are associated with an individual skill or closely related group of skills. These tend to be particular knacks that a character has acquired through the process of mastering that skill. In many cases, talents represent operational shortcuts—corners an experienced individual knows can be safely cut or particularly effective methods they can follow. Other such talents are simply natural abilities that fit in especially well with the use of that skill. These could include a certain mental process, a physical technique, or a learned pattern. A number of talents are specifically associated with conflict and fighting. These combat talents represent techniques that a character likely learned through practice and experience.

### Talent Tiers
Some talents are better than others. They may have more exciting abilities or just better mechanical boosts for your character. To balance these talents out and create an opportunity for characters to progress toward better abilities, this system sets different talents at different tiers. Each tier determines how much a talent costs in experience points.

- Tier 1: Each talent costs 5 XP.
- Tier 2: Each talent costs 10 XP.
- Tier 3: Each talent costs 15 XP.
- Tier 4: Each talent costs 20 XP.
- Tier 5: Each talent costs 25 XP.

//RULE IN TESTING
{When you are buying talents for your character, you must follow one simple rule. After buying the new tal- ent, your character must have more talents in the next lowest tier. So, if your character has two Tier 1 talents, they can only have a single Tier 2 talent, and can’t have any Tier 3 talents.

Visual example:
- Tier 5: No slots 
- Tier 4: Talent Slot
- Tier 3: Talent Slot | Talent Slot
- Tier 2: Talent Slot | Talent Slot | Talent Slot |
- Tier 1: Talent Slot | Talent Slot | Talent Slot | Talent Slot

If your character has four Tier 1 talents, they can have three Tier 2 talents, two Tier 3 talents, and a single Tier 4 talent.}

If they picked up another Tier 4 Talent, they could then get a Tier 5 Talent.

#### Talent Ranks 
- Purchasing the Same Talent Multiple Times
Most talents can only be purchased once. However, some talents are ranked, which means they can be purchased multiple times. These talents have a cumulative effect: the more of them you purchase, the better they become.

However, after you purchase the talent, the talent now counts as being in the next highest tier for the next time you want to purchase it. This means the experience cost goes up (since talents in higher tiers cost more), and this new version of the talent takes up one of your more valuable talent slots in the higher tier (the first version you purchased still takes up its original slot). If a ranked talent is already at Tier 5 (or has reached Tier 5 after multiple purchases), that talent remains at Tier 5 for any future purchases. This system is designed to encourage some difficult choices (do you keep buying more ranks in a single talent or buy the exclusive, high-tier talents when you get access to them?), and it helps ensure that every character feels a bit different.

### Talent Descriptions

The following is a breakdown of each talent. Each part of a tlaent conveys specific information.

- Name: Every talent has a name, making it easy for you to refer to the talent.
- Tier: Each talent belongs in one of five tiers, as we described previously in this section. The higher the tier, the more XP it costs for your character to purchase the talent.
- Activation: Some talents, once chosen, constantly apply to your character; these are passive talents. Toughened, which increases your character’s wound threshold, is one such talent. Once you buy it, your character always has a higher wound threshold. Other talents are active, which means you choose when your character uses the talent. Natural, for example, lets you reroll one check in a game session, and you choose when your character uses it. If a tal- ent is active, it has additional details in parentheses describing how much time and effort it takes for your character to use the talent ([Rules](#chapter-4-rules)). Finally, you can use most talents only on your character’s turn, but some talents can be used during another character’s turn. These talents have the “out of turn” descriptor.
- Ranked: Some talents are ranked, which means your character can take them more than once. We described ranked talents in more detail earlier.
- Rules: These are the rules that describe what the talent does.

#### Tier 1 Talents

##### Bought Info
- Tier: 1
- Activation: Active (Action)
- Ranked: No

When making any knowledge skill check, your character can instead use this talent to spend an amount of currency equal to fifty times the difficulty rating of the check and automatically succeed on the knowledge check instead of rolling. At your GM’s discretion, your character may not be able to use Bought Info if the information is particularly sensitive or difficult to find, or buying it doesn’t make narrative sense.

##### Clever Retort
- Tier: 1
- Activation: Active (Incidental, Out of Turn)
- Ranked: No

Once per encounter, your character may use this talent to add automatic 2 EFFECT to another character’s social skill check.

## Chapter 4: Rules

### How does it work?

Nearly everything is a TEST or CHECK. 

Potential = The higher of your STATIS or your SKILL. 

Proficiency = The lesser of your STATUS or your SKILL.

If you have Intuition 2 and Perception 3. Your Potential is 3 and your Proficiency is 2. You would roll 3D6 + 2. You would pick one of your rolled D6 as the EFFECT die before rolling; its face = EFFECT.

Roll `Potential XD6 + Proficiency`. Total must meet or beat the Threshold. One of those D6 must be a different color as it is the EFFECT Dice (see below).

#### Maximum Dice

**The most dice you can ever roll regardless of your Potential, Advantages, Edge, Circumstances is 12D6 on any test**


### Thresholds
Everything in Sixfinity revolves around tests. Tests revolve around Rating and Rating have Thresholds. A Threshold is minimum number that must be rolled on (Potential XD6) in order to reach that rating. A lot of games also call the Threshold the Target Number or TN.


| Rating (EFFECT) | Difficulty        | Threshold | Guidance                                                  |
| --------------- | ----------------- | :-------: | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0               | Routine           |     0     | Anyone can do this basically every time. Roll for EFFECT. |
| 1               | Easy              |     5     | Most people can do this most of the time                  |
| 2               | Average           |    10     | 50/50 Chance                                              |
| 3               | Hard              |    15     | Even trained people often fail                            |
| 4               | Daunting          |    20     | Normal people almost never succeed                        |
| 5               | Formidable        |    25     | Truly a monumental task that should not be attempted      |
| 6               | Nearly Impossible |    30     | Without Edge and a lot of luck this is unobtainable       |

### Critical Failure: Glitching

Also called a Botch. 

When you roll a 1 on the **Majority** of your dice. If you succeed at your task the GM *can* give you a Minor Compel. If you fail at your task the GM *can* give you a Major Compel.

#### Critical Success

When you roll a 6 on the Majority of your dice (Potential XD6), you get an immediate Edge dice to roll and add to your roll for free. You cannot bank this Edge you must spend it immediately.


### EFFECT

EFFECT tells you how well something went, or at times how poorly it went. EFFECT is also a currency that can be used in some situations (like combat to trigger Auto-Fire).

The number shown on the EFFECT Dice is the amount of EFFECT. If you succeed or fail, that is still the amount of EFFECT.

#### NET EFFECT

In some cases (mostly opposed rolls) you and the opposition will both be rolling. Whoever wins you take the higher EFFECT dice and subtract the Lower effect dice the difference is the NET EFFECT. In the event of a Zero then there was no NET EFFECT.

### Edge

Edge is a character’s luck, instincts, and ability to turn the odds in their favor.

- Edge Pool = (Agility + Talent + Tenacity) ÷ 2 (round up).

Spending Edge:

- Before rolling, you can spend 1 Edge. The most you can ever spend on a Test is 1 Edge.
- For each Edge spent, roll 1d6 and add the result to your test total.
- These d6s also increase your EFFECT if they push you over higher Ratings.

Refreshing Edge:

- Full refresh on a Long Rest.
- The GM may award Edge for clever play or roleplay.
- You may invoke an Asepct to get 2 Edge back. You can do this once per Aspect per game session.

Example: Shooting a Guard

- The Guard is at Medium Range which is Threshold 10, the GM says their defense has given them a total Threshold of 12.
- You roll (Potential XD6) = 6, add Firearms +3, Agility 2 = 11 you missed, barely.
- If you spent 1 Edge, you’d also roll 1d6.
- Let’s say you rolled 5 on the Edge dice.
- Your total is now 17 thats enough to hit the Guard and do your damage.


### ADVANTAGE and DISADVANTAGE
ADVANTAGE and DISADVANTAGE is purely adding beneficial circumstances, and adding hindrances to a players tests. This is done much the same way Edge works.

ADVANTAGE: Add 1D6 to your roll. The most advantage you can have is 4D6 even with Edge.

DISADVANTAGE: The GM rolls 1D6 per DISADVANTAGE ad adds it to the Threshold. Defense is a great example of DISADVANTAGE, for each point of Defense you have the enemy rolls 1D6 and adds it to the Threshold for them to be hit (which is based on range). Up to 4D6.

Multiple advantages and disadvantages stack. **The most D6 from any sources including Edge, Defense or otherwise to a single Test is 4.**

### Bane and Boon

Sometimes a Gamemaster wants to add a little something or take a little something off to demonstrate a minor benefit or detriment to a situation. Elevated position, superior optics etc. 

This is where Bane and Boon come from. They have no effect on your odds of success. They affect the outcome aftweards, they add or take away from EFFECT.

Boon = +1 EFFECT

Bane = -1 EFFECT

This is calculated after NET EFFECT is determined. So if you have a NET EFFECT of 3 and a Bane of 1 then your final NET EFFECT is 2. 

### Success Tests
In a Simple test, you roll `Potential XD6 + Proficiency`, and see if you meet total or beat a Threshold established by the gamemaster. The gamemaster establishes the Threshold based on the Threshold Guidelines and suggestions and guidelines established within the rules. If the the total is equal to or greater than the threshold, the action succeeds; in some occasions, the number of effect matters see EFFECT.

Written as `Potential XD6 + Proficiency (Threshold Rating)`

Such as `Agility + Firearms (15)` If you had a Agility 2 and Firearms of 3 you would roll `3D6 + 2`

This can also be written as `Firearms (15)` which has the same meaning.

If you rolled 15 or better on your total then you succeeded. 

### Opposed Tests

Opposed tests happen whenever a character has to pit her skills against another individual, living thing, or (occasionally) technological force. Maybe she’s trying to sneak by a security guard in a factory complex, knock out a belligerent ganger with her stungun, or talk Mr. Johnson into offering a higher payday. Notation for Opposed tests looks like this:

`SNEAKING + AGILITY vs PERCEPTION + INTUITION`

Note that Opposed tests do not list a threshold. That’s because in an Opposed test, you are trying to roll higher than an opponent. Sometimes the opponent is rolling the same skill + attribute combination, sometimes a different one.

In an opposed test the NET EFFECT goes to the Victor. Be careful with Edge or taking on challenges where the Disadvantages are stacked against you ... you could find the NET EFFECT to be quite punishing. No risk, no reward.

### Extended Tests

Extended tests are EFFECT Tests. You are rolling for EFFECT in these cases. They have a Skill, a Stat, and a required EFFECT. You need not meet the total EFFECT in one roll. Each roll takes as much time as the test text indicates.

Written as: Extended `Mechanics + Talent (9, 1 hour) test`

The above means make multiple `Mechanics + Talent` tests. When your total EFFECT is 9 you are done. Each roll takes 1 hour.

### Individual Rule Sections

These sections are referenced in other locations in the book for how something works. This is the central repository for this information instead of scattering it all over the book in Combat, Equipment, etc.

#### Critical Injury

A particularly dangerous type of harm is a Critical Injury. A Critical Injury is often the result of an attack during combat, but characters can also suffer one from exceeding their wound threshold or through other means. Each time a character suffers a Critical Injury, the player rolls d100 on Table Critical Injury Result, below, to determine the injury’s severity rating and effects. These effects are cumulative.

The short-term effects of some injuries are temporary, and may only disorient or afflict the character for a brief amount of time. Other injuries are more serious and represent some sort of long-term debilitation or impairment. These injuries continue to affect the character until they receive the proper medical treatment to recover from the injury.

Regardless, a Critical Injury remains with the character until properly healed; even if the short-term effect of the Critical Injury has passed, the status of having a Critical Injury remains. Each Critical Injury a character suffers from adds +10 to any subsequent Critical Injury roll. Essentially, Critical Injury is cumulative, and left untreated, even a number of relatively minor Critical Injuries can lead to devastating results.

**Critical Injury Result Table**

| D100    | Severity | Result                      |
| ------- | -------- | --------------------------- |
| 01-05   | 1        | -1 Proficiency to All Tests |

| 151+    | 5        | Dead                        |


##### Strain Damage and Critical Injuries

Although not always likely, some attacks that deal strain damage (notably weapons with the Stun Damage quality) can also trigger Critical Injuries. Although this may seem odd, it actually makes sense. When a player character inflicts a Critical Injury on an adversary that can be incapacitated by a single Critical Injury (such as a minion), then the adversary is simply incapacitated by being rendered unconscious. If a PC or nemesis NPC suffers a Critical Injury from a weapon dealing strain damage, the outcome can be anything from adverse long-term effects from the weapon, to tangential injuries from being stunned (for example, the character could be knocked off balance and take a nasty crack on the skull when they hit the ground). Of course, since these Critical Injuries would have to be triggered by the players or GM, both parties can always decide that a Critical Injury would not make sense in that narrative, and choose not to trigger them.

#### Concept

The core of your character's identity. Are they a Bounty Hunter? A Street Samurai? A Decker?

#### Trouble or Obligation

A major flaw or recurring problem that can cause your character issues this often assists in regaining Edge

#### Aspects

Your character has two of these. You can invoke, or use one of them per session to give yourself 2 Edge. These Edge last the Session until used so you can bank them above your Edge Total, they are just added to your pool for the Session.

Example: I never leave a man behind

In combat a friend has fallen and you go save them. You know you will likely need some Edge for rolls in the risky scenario so you invoke your Aspect that "I never leave a man behind" and the GM grants you 2 bonus Edge to your pool.

#### GM Compels
The GM can introduce a Compel.

- Minor Compel: You still succeed, but something annoying happens (your pistol jams, your lockpick breaks, your code tripwires a trace).
- Major Compel: You fail and something worse happens (your gun’s safety locks, the door alarms, your deck reboots).

Whenever the GM delivers a Major Compel — or at any moment he wants to add a complication — you gain 5 XP.

- You may refuse a Compel by paying 1 Edge, but then you don’t earn the 5 XP.
- If you have Edge, you must accept the Compel.

As a guideline, the GM should use Compels once or twice per session per character — enough to make things interesting, not overwhelming.

This keeps the story dynamic: every bad roll can push the narrative sideways while still rewarding players for the trouble.

#### Range

Sixfinity relies on broad terms to describe ranges and distances. Rather than have a player’s attention focused on a grid, counting squares, Sixfinity uses more abstract means to represent positions, distances, and ranges, thus allowing the players to focus on the action and the adventure. The distance between two points—people, objects, or adversaries is defined by general range categories. These range categories are used to determine how far a ranged attack can reach, how far apart two people are from each other, how much effort is needed to move between two places, and so on. The most common ranges are short, medium, long, and extreme range. Another relative position—engaged—exists to represent characters who are in extremely close proximity to each other.

##### The Five Range Bands

For ease of play, distance in Sixfinity is divided up into five different bands, from engaged to extreme. As always, the GM has the final say in determining the range between the attacker and the target. With the engaged status and the other range bands, the GM is free to describe things dynamically and set scenes without having to worry about exact distances. Exact distances in yards do not matter. The details and adventure come first, creating a vivid picture in the minds of the players while allowing the GM to quickly provide the mechanical information they need to use their actions and build strategies.

**Engaged**
- Threshold: 5 + Engaged modifiers

To reflect two or more targets who are grappling or otherwise engaged in hand-to-hand combat, there is a special range status called engaged. Two characters engaged with each other are in very close proximity. A warrior needs to be engaged with a target to hit them with their sword. When two or more characters are engaged with each other, it is called an engagement. Engaged is also used to indicate that a person is close enough to an item to use it. A hacker needs to be engaged with a security terminal to attempt to hack it. A pilot needs to be engaged with their fighter jet to board it. A hunter needs to be engaged with a tree if they want to hide behind it for cover while tracking their target. The engaged status simply indicates that two things are close enough to each other to directly interact. Consider engaged as a subcategory of short range. Obviously, someone can be slightly farther away if they’re at short range, instead of being engaged with someone else. However, the difference in distance is relatively minor. Thus, spending a maneuver to move to engage someone or something is as much a matter of moving into combat cautiously enough to avoid receiving a blow unnecessarily as it is moving a physical distance.

**Short Range**
- Threshold: 5

Short range indicates up to several yards between targets. Many thrown weapons and small firearms are most accurate at short range. Two people within short range of each other can talk comfortably without raising their voices. Moving to another spot within short range is usually easy to do and generally only requires one maneuver.

**Medium Range**
- Threshold: 10

Medium range can be up to several dozen yards away. More reliable pistols can reach to medium range, but few thrown weapons can reach this far. Two people within medium range of each other need to talk loudly to hear each other. Moving from short range to medium range takes little exertion and generally requires one maneuver.

**Long Range**
- Threshold: 15

Long range is farther than a few dozen yards. Rifles, mounted weapons, and weapons that use the Gunnery skill can reliably reach this far without too much trouble. Two people within long range of each other need to yell loudly to hear each other. Moving from medium range to long range requires two actions, as it involves a greater distance and takes more time than moving between medium range and short range. This means that in most cases, a character cannot close the distance between short and long range in a single round, as it would take three actions (one for short to medium, plus two for medium to long).

**Extrem Range**
- Threshold: 20

Extreme range is the farthest range at which two targets can interact. High-tech sniper weaponry and some vehicle-mounted armaments may reach out to this range. Two people at extreme range may not be able to hear each other even if they shout. Moving between long range and extreme range can be time-consuming and exerting, and it requires two maneu- vers. This means that in most cases, a character can move the entire distance between long and extreme range in a single round, but suffers strain or gives up their action to do so.



#### Key Concepts

**Action, Major:** Anything a character does that is significant, such as attacks, casting spells.

**Action, Minor:** Character actions like moving, taking cover, avoiding incoming attacks, taking attacks of opportunity, reloading weapons, etc. 

**ADVANTAGE:** Adds 1D6 to the person rolling.

**Character:** Any creature in the game capable of acting whether it is a player character, PC, run by a player or a non-player character, NPC, run by the Game Master, GM. In the Sixfinity system, even bizarre creatures, sentient machines, and living energy beings can be characters.

**Difficulty:** Synonymous with rating. Ranges 0-5.

**DISADVANTAGE:** Adds 1D6 to pposed roll or to the Threshold of a test.

**Edge:** Edge is a character’s luck, instincts, and ability to turn the odds in their favor. Comes in a pool that allows 1D6 to be added to a test. Purchasable ADVANTAGE

**EFFECT:** The total on the EFFECT Dice.

**EFFECT, Net:** The amount of effect left over after the reduction of the effect of an opponent or an obstacle.

**Roll:** A D6 roll made by a PC to determine whether an action is successful. Although the game occasionally uses other dice, when the text simply refers to "a roll", it always means a D6 roll.

**Rating:** Difficulty Rating is a measure of how easy it is to accomplish a task. Rating is rated on a scale from one at the lowest to five at the highest.

**Round:** A length of time about 5 to 10 seconds long. There are about 10 rounds in a minute when it's really important to track precise time use rounds. Basically it's the length of time to take an action, a major one, in the game. But since everyone more or less acts simultaneously, all characters get to take an action each round and a minor action each round regardless of what their initiative is.

**Test:** Any action that a PC attempts, the GM determines the difficulty of the test. In general, a test is something you do and an action is something you are performing during that test. But in most cases, they mean the same thing.

**Threshold:** The target number you need to achieve in order to accomplish that rating of difficulty.

**Turn:** The part of the round when a character or creature takes its actions. For example, if a street samurai and an adept are fighting an orc, each round the street samurai takes an action on their turn. The adept takes an action on their turn and the orc takes an action on their turn. Some abilities or effects last only one turn or end when the turn is started.

#### Defense

Defense, or specifically, defense rating, is one of the factors determining how difficult it is to land a successful attack during combat. Defense ratings represent the abilities of shields, armor, or other defenses to deflect attacks entirely, or to absorb or lessen incoming blows. A character adds a number of Diasadvantage equal to their defense rating to all combat checks directed against them. No character can have a defense rating higher than 4.

##### Melee and Ranged Defense
A character’s defense rating can be classified as one of two types: melee defense rating, or ranged defense rating. A melee defense rating only applies against close combat checks directed against the character (Brawl, Melee A ranged defense rating only applies against ranged combat checks directed against the character (Gunnery, Ranged, and Ranged [Heavy] checks).

There are two sources of defense: sources that stack, and sources that do not stack. You can think of this as sources that **provide** defense, and sources that increase defense. Sources that **provide** defense (such as most armor) list the defense provided as a number, or say that they "**provide**" defense. Some examples include:
- Armor
- Cover
- Certain talents

These sources do not stack with each other. If a character could benefit from more than one of these sources of defense, you choose the best one. 

However, other sources increase defense. These sources say they **increase** defense, or they list the defense provided as a number with a “+” sign in front of it. These sources of defense stack, both with each other and with any sources that provide defense. If multiple sources that increase defense would increase a character’s defense higher than 4, the rating remains at 4. As 4 is the **absolute highest Defense can be**.

#### Soak

A character’s soak value helps protect them from incoming wounds. Most creatures and characters have a default soak value equal to their Stamina rating.

Most types of armor and other forms of protection provide additional soak (see Equipment).

When taking damage from attacks (actions involving a combat skill test) or other sources of physical damage (such as being struck by a falling rock or being hit by a speeding car), the character may reduce the damage taken by their soak value. After calculating the total amount of damage inflicted, subtract the total soak value from that damage total. The result is the number of wounds the character suffers. If the soak reduces the damage to zero or less than zero, then the character takes no damage. If the character suffers multiple hits from a single attack (such as from a weapon with Auto-fire), they apply their soak to each hit separately.

Soak stacks when it is from different sources, such as heavy assault armor and subdermal plating. Multiple applications of the same source do not stack, however. A character cannot wear three suits of heavy assault armor and stack the soak bonuses from each.

Soak does not reduce strain inflicted on a target, except in specific instances (such as when hit by a weapon with the Stun Damage item quality).

#### Determining Test Difficulty


#### Direct Neural Interface or DNI
- Shadowrun

A direct neural interface, or DNI, connects your brain to electronic devices. Direct neural interface (along with a sim module) is required for VR use, but DNI is also useful for AR in that you don’t need any additional gear like earbuds or an image link to see or hear augmented reality objects. How do you sign up? You get DNI by wearing trodes, or having an implanted datajack, commlink, or cyberdeck. And if you’re using a sim module along with your DNI, you can get a sort of “super AR mode” where you can also feel, smell, and taste your AR experience.

## Chapter 6: Skills
// Locked for Playtest

The vast majority of a character's actions are governed by abilities that he has learned through education or experience. Any time he attempts an action which has a reasonable chance of success or failure, his skills come into play as a means of determining the result. In some instances, the task may be so trivial or the character so capable that the Game Master may not call for a check. Other times, the task is so outlandish that the player might choose to act differently once the odds are calculated. Ultimately, when there is a reasonable chance of failure, the player must depend upon his character's skills to see him through to success.

Skill values fulfill this role in conjunction with STATIS. These two values interact to directly establish the Potential and Proficiency dice used when attempting any action. A character's innate abilities are generally described by STATIS, while skills require learning and practice. In this way, the intersection of education and natural ability contributes to a character's chances of success or failure. 

### WHAT ARE SKILLS?

Anything that a character might learn could be considered a skill. Not everything a person might learn has applications that fit well within a dramatic game. To reflect this,Sixfinity includes a list of skills that are most likely to come up in the course of dramatic adventures set within the the Sixth World. The list may not cover every imaginable situation, but it should address those that are most likely to come up during the course of a game session. 

Skills are divided into four categories based upon their general application and use. 

Knowledge skills are entirely cerebral. They do not govern action—only understanding. These can never be used Untrained.

Combat skills deal with how a character may act and react in a direct physical confrontation. Other skills may be useful during an altercation, but combat skills can seldom be used without violence. 

General Skills are skills that deal with characters taking non-combat actions are considered General skills. 

Magic skills deal entirely with Magic. These can never be used Untrained.

### SKILL RATINGS

Skill ratings begin at a level of 1. The maximum rating for a Skill is 5 (6 with Augmentation). Starting characters cannot have a Skill higher than 2. Characters with no rating in a skill are considered untrained, but they may still attempt to perform a function covered by a skill by defaulting to an STATIS by only using the `Potential XD6 + 0`, some skills are inherently so complex you cannot use them without training.

| Skill Rating | Definition   |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| 0            | Unaware      |
| 1            | Proficient   |
| 2            | Apprentice   |
| 3            | Journeyman   |
| 4            | Professional |
| 5            | Mastery      |
| 6            | Augmented    |

### Defaulting

It is impossible to prepare for every scenario and only slightly harder to have every skill. When you perform an action without actually having the skill for the test, there’s still hope. You can default the skill, making the test using only raw talent. You don’t have any tremendous talent when you default— quite the opposite in fact. Characters with no rating in a skill are considered untrained, but they may still attempt to perform a function covered by a skill by defaulting to an STATIS by only using the `Potential XD6 + Proficiency`, some skills are inherently so complex you cannot use them without training. Unless the gamemaster feels that you’re at a complete loss when defaulting, you can use Edge and better your chances by lowering the Rating.

### Tests

In Sixfinity you compare the STATIS and the SKILL Rating, the higher of the two determines your Potential, which is the number of D6 you roll. You add the lower number as a flat value to your roll representing your Proficiency.

### GENERAL SKILLS 

This group of skills represents the majority of the actions that a character attempts. In dramatic situations, the entire success or failure of a mission might ride on how effectively a given character uses one of these skills. While general skills do not govern violent actions, life and death may ride upon their effective use. 

#### Athletics

Athletic skill governs exceptional training in a particular aspect of physical endeavors. Such as running, climbing, lifting, jumping, swimming.

Your character should use this skill if...
- Your character attempts to climb up or down a structure, particularly when the climb may be tricky or the drop to the bottom is significant.
- Your character tries to swim in difficult conditions. High winds, waves, tides, and currents could all contribute to making swimming difficult enough to require an Athletics check.
- Your character tries to jump, either vertically or horizontally. Leaping across a deep chasm or trying to jump up and grab a fire escape to get away from an angry dog are both situations when your character needs to make an Athletics check.
- Your character attempts to run for an extended time.

#### Computer

The Computers skill grants your character proficiency in the operation of computers and electronic systems. Possessing a lot of ranks in Computers might allow your character to build computer systems, write complex programs, design security systems. In addition, the Computers skill allows your character to manipulate computerized systems in ways that might be considered outside of the manufacturer’s specs. In other words, it allows your character to do risky, possibly illegal things like hacking, encoding and decoding encryption, and bypassing security systems.

Your character should use this skill if...
- Your character attempts to pick an electronic lock, access a building’s computing systems, or disarm a high-tech security system.
- Your character wants to crack the encryption on secure files or messages.
- Your character hacks into a database or computer system, or defends against a hacking attempt.
- Your character remotely pilots a small, hand- launched drone to do more than just fly it around a park. If a drone is big enough, like a Global Hawk or other full-sized uncrewed aerial vehicle, the Piloting skill might make more sense.

#### Cool

Staying calm and maintaining composure, outwaiting an opponent, generally being cool: these exemplify things your character does with the Cool skill. Cool is something of a defensive skill in nature, since it most often comes up as the skill your character uses to resist attempts to sway or affect them. Cool also represents how your character appears to other people. If your character doesn’t want to show that something affected them, they would use the Cool skill to keep their emotions invisible.

Even though Cool isn’t a social skill, it is often used in social encounters. If you want to make a character who is particularly effective in social encounters, you may want to invest in Cool.

Your character should use this skill if...
- Your character begins laying a trap, staging an ambush, or otherwise setting up a combat encoun- ter in which your character initiates the combat and has to judge the right time to do so.
- Your character needs to stay calm and unaffected when being flattered or charmed by someone.
- Your character needs to refrain from saying or doing something foolish during a tense situation.
- Your character needs to keep their nerve in a tense situation, such as when piloting one of two vehicles headed toward each other at high speed.
- Your character plays a card game or other game of chance in which bluffing, luck, and gambling are all intertwined.

#### Coordination

In the course of adventures, characters sometimes find themselves needing to stay stable on unsteady surfaces, crawl through narrow openings, or even land safely after a fall. Overcoming these types of challenges requires a sense of balance and a heightened degree of flexibility, both of which are represented by the Coordination skill. Coordination serves as a measure of your character’s flexibility, sure-footedness, and hand-eye coordination.

Your character should use this skill if...
- Your character tries to swing back and forth on a rope or rappel down a structure.
- Your character walks across a narrow surface while trying to keep their balance.
- Your character tries to squeeze into a tiny or cramped space such as a crawlspace, sewer pipe, air duct, or narrow crevice.
- Your character falls and needs to try to slow the fall or land safely.
- Your character needs to escape from physical restraints (such as handcuffs or ropes) and wants to contort their limbs or hands so that they can slip out of their bindings.

#### Discipline
Discipline is your character’s ability to focus their mind and quiet their thoughts. Discipline represents your character’s maintaining self-mastery and focus, specifically. Your character also uses Discipline to overcome fear or terror and stay calm in the face of the horrifying. In addition, Discipline represents your character’s mental fortitude to resist threats or coercion.

Your character should use this skill if...
- Your character confronts something terrifying and wants to avoid fleeing in horror (or to avoid other debilitating effects of fear).
- Your character tries to keep their sanity in the face of something that defies reality and rational thought.
- Your character wants to heal strain they are suffer- ing from at the end of an encounter.
- Your character wants to meditate, calm their mind, and reach a mental equilibrium.

#### Deception

When your character needs to lie to someone, they use Deception. In fact, the Deception skill covers most attempts to fool or deceive someone, which makes the skill one of the more straightforward skills to use. One thing you should keep in mind, though, is that although lying is one of the most common ways to deceive someone, it’s not the only way. Your character may attempt to trick someone by only telling them certain facts and omitting others, or by using a misleading phrase. But even if you argue that your character technically told the truth, their actions still fall into the category of Deception.

Your character should use this skill if...
- Your character tells a lie.
- Your character tries to mislead someone through clever wordplay or selective omission of certain facts.
- Your character wears a disguise and pretends to be someone else.

#### Drive

Drive is the skill that governs the use of wheeled, tracked, or otherwise ground-based vehicles. It also includes such things as submarines, sailboats, and nautical craft.

Your character should use this skill if...
- Your character wants to bring a vehicle to a safe stop after one of its tires is damaged.
- Your character tries to keep up speed while round- ing hairpin curves when driving a vehicle.
- Your character attempts to catch up to someone else in a vehicle (if the target is on foot, a check should only be necessary if they try to escape in a crowd or through a narrow space).
- Your character swerves to avoid an animal darting across the road, or tries to avoid a falling rock on a winding mountain pass.

#### Etiquette

The ability to compliment, flatter, woo, and generally make other people like you is something that’s pretty important to a lot of player characters. For characters who want to be likable, popular, and good at persuading other people to do what they want them to do, Etiquette is the skill they rely on. A character with a lot of ranks in Etiquette may be unctuous and insincerely flattering, or maybe they’re just a genuinely nice person.

Your character should use this skill if...
- Your character tries to persuade someone to do your character a favor, especially if it might be inconvenient, expensive, or even dangerous for that person.
- Your character tries to appeal to someone’s better nature (even if it doesn’t exist!) to get them to do something out of character for that person.
- Your character tries to flirt with, seduce, or make a romantic overture to someone.
- Your character tries to make themselves look bet- ter to everyone around them. A lot of politicians and public figures have high ranks in Etiquette.
- Your character performs in front of an audience, act- ing, playing music, telling jokes, or giving a speech.

#### Intimidation

Some people believe that the only way to maintain respect is to be feared. Others have learned that the best way to get what they want is through screaming and the threat of violence. When your character attempts to instill obedience in a target through the use of threats or acts of physical intimidation, they use the Intimidation skill. Characters with multiple ranks in Intimidation are often intimidating, scary, or even evil individuals. However, even good hearted people may use Intimidation to intimidate opponents so they can win a fight without bloodshed.

Your character should use this skill if...
- Your character issues a threat, whether or not accompanied by hostile actions. Even an implied threat—such as gesturing toward a weapon—falls under the Intimidation skill.
- Your character questions or interrogates a prisoner.
- Your character uses physical or psychological torture.

#### Leadership
While some may follow out of a sense of duty or fear, good leaders inspire their followers through a combination of charisma, bravery, and forceful personality. We represent this quality through the Leadership skill. Basically, Leadership is a combination of making smart decisions, being firm and decisive when doing so, and instilling a sense of loyalty and respect in your subordinates. Leadership also represents your character knowing the right decisions to make when authority is called for. Obviously, military commanders rely on Leadership, as do politicians, business owners, and even crime bosses.

Your character should use this skill if...
- Your character’s allies are suffering from fear, and you want to try to rally them.
- Your character tries to convince a crowd of citizens to take political action.
- Your character leads troops into battle and wants to make sure they follow your character’s orders.
- Your character tries to convince a mob of rioters to stand down and return to their homes.

#### Mechanics

Mechanics is about making things do the things you want them to do. Making cars move, planes fly, boats float and machines spin and roar as they can achieve whatever purpose they were built for. The Mechanics skill allows your character to build, disassemble, repair, or modify just about anything mechanical, from a broken radio to a wrecked gyrocopter. In addition, the Mechanics skill is used when salvaging technology, building fortifications, or troubleshooting a malfunctioning water pump, or any time your character needs to swing a hammer or turn a wrench.

Your character should use this skill if...
- Your character needs to repair a damaged weapon, vehicle, or other piece of equipment.
- Your character needs to identify any parts or tools necessary prior to completing a job. This can save time and money on the project.
- Your character has access to a supply of compo- nents and tools and wants to design a completely new device.
- Your character needs to sabotage an enemy’s vehi- cle or find a weak point in their defenses.
- Your character needs to build an item or modify it.
- Your character tries to install and modify cybernetic implants (although if you want, working on a cybernetic implant may require a Medicine and a Mechanics check to represent the fusion of human and machine).

#### Medicine

In the course of their adventures, we expect your character to suffer injuries: everything from cuts and bruises to broken bones and bullet wounds. Medicine gets your character and their friends back on their feet. Any attempt to heal an organic character requires Medicine, as do other medical procedures such as elective surgery and installing cybernetics, and working with poisons, diseases, parasites, and drugs.

Your character should use this skill if...
- They or another character has suffered wounds, and your character wants to heal those wounds.
- Your character tries to counteract or administer a poison.
- Your character needs to cure a disease.
- Your character creates a new pharmaceutical (or recreational) drug.
- They or another character has suffered a Critical Injury, and your character wants to heal it.
- Your character performs a complex medical procedure such as surgery, cybernetic augmentation, or psychotherapy.

**MEDICINE CHECK DIFFICULTY**

| **CURRENT CONDITION**                                  | **DIFFICULTY** |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| Current wounds equal half of wound threshold or less   | 1: Easy        |
| Current wounds equal more than half of wound threshold | 2: Average     |
| Current wounds exceed wound threshold                  | 3: Hard        |
| Has Critical Injury from being in Overflow             | Injury Rating  |

#### Perception

When your character wants to make an active attempt to study their surroundings, notice clues in a crime scene, or search for hidden foes, they use the Perception skill to do so. Perception represents your character’s conscious use of all five senses to observe their environment. In any case, the most important point is that Perception represents your character’s active use of these senses.

Your character should use this skill if...
- Your character wants to search a crime scene for clues.
- Your character wants to study the surrounding landscape for possible threats.
- Your character conducts surveillance on an unaware target from a distance.
- Your character studies an ancient relic, trying to spot any minute details that could reveal its pur- pose or construction.

#### Negotiation

When your character wants to make a deal, they’re going to use Negotiation. If Intimidation is threatening someone, Deception is lying to someone, Etiquette is sweet-talking someone, and Leadership is telling someone what to do, Negotiation is convincing someone to do what you want by giving them something they want in return. The skill in Negotiation comes from getting as much as you can out of a deal while offering as little as possible to the person you negotiate with.

Your character should use this skill if...
- Your character tries to purchase goods or services and wants to haggle over the price.
- Your character tries to sell goods or services and turn a profit. In this case, your character needs to use Negotiation to raise the price.
- Your character attempts to broker a political agree- ment or treaty between two parties.

#### Pilot

This skill covers the operation of any aerial vehicle that requires reflexes and hand-eye coordination to operate, from gyrocopters and helicopters, to jet fighters and gliders, all the way up to starfighters and spacecapable drop ships. Regardless, if something flies through the air or through space and requires a pilot with quick reflexes and a hot hand on the throttle and joystick (or their equivalent), then you’ll need Piloting to operate it!

Your character should use this skill if...
- Your character needs to land an airplane with one (or both!) engines out.
- Your character tries to outmaneuver opponents in a dogfight.
- Your character flies a drop ship through a maze of needle-sharp rock spires to a landing zone.

#### Resilience
When the going gets tough, the tough rely on their Resilience skill to keep going. Resilience represents your character’s ability to overcome pain and fight through fatigue. Characters with ranks in Resilience are also better at resisting poisons and diseases, and surviving hostile environments. When your character stumbles into a small Alaskan town after surviving two weeks on the frozen tundra, they have their Resilience skill to thank.

Your character should use this skill if...
- Your character tries to go without sleeping for days on end, and you need to see if they stay awake.
- Your character ingests a toxin, and you need to see how bad the effects are.
- Your character endures a hostile environment (somewhere too hot, too cold, or even too polluted) for days on end.
- Your character attempts to recover from a Critical Injury on their own, without medical attention.


#### Skullduggery
Skulduggery encompasses a broad range of skills that are crucial to performing criminal actions. These include the physical abilities to perform a crime as well as the mental familiarity with different techniques. This includes picking pockets and locks, breaking into and out of secure facilities, sleight of hand, disguise, setting traps, and other mischievous actions. 

Your character should use this skill if...
- Your character attempts to pick someone’s pocket or lift their wallet.
- Your character tries to pick a lock or disable a trap. Your character would also use Skulduggery to set a trap in the first place.
- Your character wants to study a security system.
- Your character attempts to distract an opponent through guile or a feint, such as by throwing a handful of dirt in their eyes during a fight.

#### Stealth

When your character wants to act unnoticed by anyone else, they use the Stealth skill. In many ways, Stealth is one of the simpler skills, and it covers a pretty specific set of activities.

Your character should use this skill if...
- Your character attempts to hide from someone.
- Your character tries to tail someone through a crowd, and to do it without being noticed.
- Your character tries to infiltrate a government installation while avoiding both electronic security and human guards.
- Your character tries to move quietly through a house.

#### Streetwise
The Streetwise skill represents the instinctive understanding that comes from a lifetime of such experiences. While a few manage to learn the signs and develop a gut instinct through careful study and association with those who have lived this hard life, most come about this information through the school of hard knocks. If a character expects to thrive within the complex network of the criminal underworld, he must learn to speak its language and recognize the roles of those involved. 

Your character should use this skill if...
- Your character looks for a merchant who sells black-market goods or illegal services.
- Your character wants to understand particular ref- erences or slang in a conversation.
- Your character tries to approach criminals and start up a conversation without appearing like an outsider or a threat.
- Your character tries to find their way around an unfamiliar city.
- Your character tries to track and hunt someone somewhere in a city.


#### Survival
There are a thousand tricks your character needs to master in order to survive in the wilderness, and the more ranks in Survival they have, the more likely they are to know them. The Survival skill covers your character’s ability to find food and water, cope with dangerous conditions, hunt and skin animals, and, well, survive in any location that doesn’t have a supermarket on the corner.

Your character should use this skill if...
- Your character is trapped in the wilderness and needs to find food and potable water.
- Your character needs to notice approaching severe weather and know how to prepare for it.
- Your character needs to follow a crude map or direc- tions through a rural area to find a specific location.
- Your character tries to tame or calm a wild animal, or handle a domesticated animal.
- Your character hunts something (or someone!) through a wilderness setting.

#### Vigilance
Vigilance represents the ability to be constantly aware of your surroundings, often without consciously making the effort. Characters with ranks in Vigilance are more likely to spot threats in their environment, notice important clues out of the corner of their eye, and catch lies as they’re being told.

You probably noticed from the description that Vigilance, more than most other skills, is a bit of a passive skill. In fact, Vigilance is supposed to be used when your character doesn’t expect a threat, isn’t looking for a clue, or is otherwise unaware of something important. This is why we use it to determine Initiative in combat when a character is surprised, to see how much that character was paying attention. It also means that when your GM asks you to make a Vigilance check, you may suspect that something is up. Your character, however, shouldn’t be suspicious (unless they pass the check!) Vigilance is also one of skills that you use to oppose certain social skill checks (primarily Deception) when those checks target your character.

Your character should use this skill if...

- Your character just got ambushed, and you are roll- ing to determine Initiative order. A high Vigilancemeans your character has a better chance of reacting quickly to the threat.
- Your character is being lied to; the opponent’s Deception check is opposed by your character’s Vigilance skill.
- Your character has a chance to notice important details in their surroundings while not looking for them directly.

### COMBAT SKILLS

Skills that are tightly focused on use during physical confrontations are considered Combat skills. Application of these abilities is almost always violent, but need not be deadly. Full details on using Combat skills during conflicts are described in Combat.

#### Brawl
This skill governs unarmed combat.

Your character should use this skill if...
- Your character fights with their bare hands or a weapon specifically designed to augment an unarmed attack, such as cestus or brass knuckles (or even a roll of coins).
- Your character tries to pin, grapple, or hold someone.
- Your character uses some form of unarmed martial art.

#### Gunnery

Your character uses Gunnery, the third of the Ranged sub-skills, to fire machine guns, plasma cannons, heavy railguns, missile launchers, grenade launchers, and pretty much any other weapon large enough that you need a tripod or team of people to use it. Your character also uses it to fire weapons mounted on vehicles.

Your character should use this skill if...
- Your character shoots a machine gun, cannon, missile launcher, or other “crewed” weapon.

#### Melee

This skill governs the use of hand to hand weapons of all sizes and weights.

Your character should use this skill if...
- Your character fights with a sword, rapier, dirk, mace, axe, spear, halberd, knife...we could go on, but you get the idea.
- Your character fights in a duel.

#### Ranged Light

Your character uses Ranged (Light) to shoot pistols, throw knives, and toss grenades at their opponents. This skill covers pretty much every light ranged weapon designed to be fired (or thrown) from one hand.

Your character should use this skill if...
- Your character shoots a pistol, submachine gun, flechette pistol, laser pistol, or a similar weapon.
- Your character wants to hurl a throwing knife.
- Your character wants to toss a grenade.

#### Ranged Heavy

Your character uses Ranged (Heavy) to shoot rifles, shotguns, assault
rifles, laser rifles, and similar weapons. This skill covers
pretty much every heavy ranged weapon designed to be
fired while carried in two hands, but not large enough
that it requires multiple people or a tripod to use.

Your character should use this skill if...
- Your character shoots a shotgun, assault rifle, flamethrower, flechette launcher, sniper rifle, or similar weapon.

### KNOWLEDGE SKILLS
The actions that a character takes are often performed in reaction to his knowledge about a situation. Players can never be expected to know as much about life in the game setting as the characters who have lived there. Knowledge skills serve to bridge this gap. They enable a player to make decisions about his character's actions that are informed by what his character might know. 

#### Academics

Most SINless grow up without a formal education. However, even those people with a hoity toity piece of paper fall on hard times and join the ranks of shadowrunners.

This skill represents the character’s understanding of topics normally taught in schools. The humanities (cultures, art, philosophy, etc) are also included in this. A single rank in this skill may indicate a primary school education, whereas a second rank would represent some sort of secondary school. 

More ranks may represent the equivalent of a college education. Five ranks would be a master in their field.

Your character should use this skill if...
- Your character tries to do something academic, such as calculate a theorem, conduct an experiment, or write a history thesis.
- Your character tries to research a certain topic through academic means.
- Your character performs critical thinking or tries to figure out a logic puzzle.
- Your character tries to find out if they know an important fact about the world around them that they may have learned in school.
- Your character tries to find out information about people or organizations tied to an Academic background.

#### Interests

Runners aren’t all shooting people and getting shot at. Some have hobbies outside of death and destruction. This skill represents things you know because of what you do for fun.

One rank may represent someone knowing the names of all the Urban Brawl teams. Two ranks may represent knowing players and coaches. More ranks may represent in-depth knowledge that only true fans would know. Five ranks is reaching true geek levels. These are the ones who start massive flame wars online in Matrix hosts dedicated to the topic.


Your character should use this skill if...
- Your character tries to recall a fact about pop culture, leisure activity, pastime, sports team, etc.
- Your character tries to research information related to a hobby or pop culture.
- Your character tries to find out information about people or organizations tied to pop culture, sports, or other hobby.

#### Magic

True magic came back to the world during the Awakening several decades ago, but there is a rich history of it from previous ages of the world. Studying ancient tomes can yield powerful magical effects and abilities. Mages and Shamans can extend their power by learning these ancient secrets.

Your character should use this skill if...
- Your character is casting a spell that increases affects by the character’s knowledge. Use this knowledge skill’s ranks for that number.
- Your character tries to research information related to magical artifacts, magical theory, spirits, or other mystical elements.
- Your character tries to find out if they know an important fact about magical creatures, spells, spirits, foci, or other magical things.

#### Professional

Corporations tend to hate other corporations and hire you to hurt said corporations. As dull as it may sound, knowing information about normal trades, professions, and occupations can pan out useful information on a run.

Your character should use this skill if...
- Your character is trying to find out information about people that work for corporations or the cor- porations themselves.
- Your character tries to find out procedures that security companies usually follow.
- Your character tries to find out where to purchase legal goods not available at your local Stuffer Shack.

#### Street
Knowing how things get done in the shadows and the people to watch out for or that may be able to help you in a bind can save your life out on the streets. Ranks in this skill represent your knowledge of the neighborhoods, gang territories, organized crime members, and the peo- ple in the know.

Your character should use this skill if...
- Your character tries to find out which Yakuza gumi controls an area.
- Your character tries to recognize which gang colors a particular thug is wearing.
- Your character tries to research safehouses in the area.

### MAGIC SKILLS

#### Conjuring
Conjuring represents a character’s ability to summon, bind, and banish spirits or other metaphysical entities. Characters with ranks in Conjuring are more likely to draw the attention of powerful spirit allies, successfully maintain their control, and dismiss hostile entities before they cause harm.

Conjuring is often used when your character seeks to extend their influence beyond the physical world by calling upon supernatural forces. This includes summoning elementals for combat, enlisting a guardian spirit for protection, or attempting to banish a possessing entity. It also determines how much strain or backlash a magician suffers when things go wrong—spirits are powerful and unpredictable, and the skill of the summoner often decides whether they are allies or hazards.

Your character should use this skill if…
- Your character is summoning a spirit to fight alongside the party or perform a specific task.
- Your character is attempting to banish or dismiss a hostile entity.
- Your character is binding a spirit to a long-term service or ward.

#### Sorcery
Sorcery represents a character’s ability to manipulate raw magical energy to create spells. Characters with ranks in Sorcery are more likely to successfully cast offensive and defensive spells, shape magical effects with precision, and resist the dangerous feedback of failed castings.

Sorcery is often used when your character channels mana directly to achieve an immediate effect. This includes hurling destructive firebolts, shielding allies from harm, or weaving illusions to deceive the senses. It is also the primary skill used to counter hostile spellcasting, unraveling an enemy’s working before it takes hold. Sorcery is at the heart of most Awakened traditions, and mastery of it defines the raw power of a spellcaster.

Your character should use this skill if…
- Your character is casting an offensive spell to harm, disable, or hinder an enemy.
- Your character is weaving protective wards or shielding allies from incoming attacks.
- Your character is attempting to counter or dispel another caster’s magic.


## Chapter 7: Equipment



#### Item Qualities

Some equipment features special qualities that add variety and depth to the weapons, armor, and items your character may encounter. In our game, item quali- ties are special rules that can change how the item acts. They let us add more variety to an item than we could by only manipulating its raw STATIS. They also make the items more interesting for you, since many qualities may require you to think about your character using that item differently.

Special qualities are generally either passive or active. Passive qualities are always “on” and require no activation on the part of the user. Active qualities must be triggered by the user, often by spending one or more EFFECT to activate the quality.

Item qualities usually have a number associated with them. This is their rating. Ratings affect qualities in different ways, depending on the quality in question.

Active qualities require 2 EFFECT to activate unless otherwise stated in their description. Active item qualities on weapons can only trigger on a successful attack, unless specified otherwise.


**Accurate (Passive)**

Accurate weapons are easier to aim or wield, whether through design or technology. For each level of this quality, the attacker adds 1 BOON to their combat checks while using this weapon.

**Auto-Fire (Active)**

A weapon with Auto-fire can be set to shoot in rapid succession and potentially spray an area with bolts, flechettes, slugs, or other types of projectiles. The advantage in using Auto-fire is that it has the chance to hit multiple targets or to hit a single target multiple times. As attacking with a weapon on Auto-fire is generally less accurate, the attacker suffers 1 DISADVANTAGE to hit. The user may choose not to use the Auto-fire quality on a weapon; in this case, they cannot trigger the quality but also do not suffer the aforementioned penalty.

If the attack hits. For every 2 EFFECT of the roll it deals an additional hit to the target. Each of these counts as an additional hit from that weapon, and each hit deals base damage plus NET EFFECT from the test.

These additional hits can be allocated to the original target, or to other targets within range of the weapon. If the attacker wishes to hit multiple targets, they must decide to do so before making the test. Furthermore, if they wish to hit multiple targets, their initial target must always be the target with the highest difficulty and highest defense (if this is two separate targets, the GM chooses which is the initial target). The initial hit must always be against the initial target. Subsequent hits generated can be allocated to any of the other designated targets.

**Blast (Active)**

The weapon has a large spread, an explosive blast, or a similar area of effect, like a detonated grenade or a warhead fired from a missile launcher. If the attack is successful and Blast activates, each character (friend or foe) engaged with the original target suffers a hit dealing damage equal to the Blast quality’s rating, plus damage equal to the total NET EFFECT scored on the test. In a relatively small and enclosed area, the Game Master might decide that everyone in the room suffers damage. If the Blast quality doesn’t activate, the ordnance still detonates, but bad luck or poor aim on the part of the firer (or quick reactions on the part of the targets) means the explosion may not catch anyone else in its radius. 

However, the user may also trigger Blast if the attack misses by spending 3 EFFECT. In this case, the original target and every target engaged with the original target suffers a hit dealing damage equal to the Blast rating of the weapon.

**Breach (Passive)**

Weapons with Breach burn through the toughest armor; they are often heavy weapons or weapons mounted on some sort of vehicle. Hits from weapons with the Breach quality ignore one point of vehicle armor for every rating of Breach (mean- ing they also ignore 10 soak for every rating of Breach).

**Burn (Active)** 

Weapons with Burn inflict damage over time. When Burn is triggered, one target hit by the attack continues to suffer the weapon’s base damage each round for a number of rounds equal to the weapon’s Burn rating. Apply damage at the start of each of the target’s turns. If multiple targets suffer hits from a weapon with Burn, the quality may be triggered multiple times, affecting a different target each time.

A victim might be able to stop the damage by performing an action to roll around and make a Coordination check. The difficulty is Average on hard surfaces such as the floor of a building, or an Easy on grass or soft ground. Jumping into a body of water stops the damage immediately. Both situations assume the flame is from actual combustion rather than a chemical reaction. With the latter, there is usually little the victim can do.

**Concussive (Active)**

The weapon’s attack can leave the target shell-shocked from mighty blows or punishing shock waves, unable to perform any but the most basic actions. When Concussive is triggered, one target hit by the attack is staggered for a number of rounds equal to the weapon’s Concussive rating. A staggered target cannot perform actions. If multiple targets suffer hits from a weapon with Concussive, the quality may be triggered multiple times, affecting a different target each time.

**Cumbersome (Passive)**

A Cumbersome weapon is large, unwieldy, awkward, or heavy. To wield a Cumbersome weapon properly, the character needs a Stamina characteristic equal to or greater than the weapon’s Cumbersome rating. For each point of Stamina by which the character is deficient, they must take DISADVANTAGE by 1 per deficiency.

**Defensive (Passive)**

An item with the Defensive quality increases the user’s melee defense by its Defensive rating.

**Deflection (Passive)**

An item with the Deflection quality increases the user’s ranged defense by its Deflection rating.

**Disorient (Active)**

A weapon with Disorient can daze an opponent. When Disorient is triggered, one target hit by the attack is disoriented for a number of rounds equal to the weapon’s Disorient rating. A disoriented target adds 1 BANE to all skill checks they perform. If multiple targets suffer hits from a weapon with Disorient, the quality may be triggered multiple times, affecting a different target each time.

**Ensnare (Active)**

A weapon with Ensnare binds a foe and restricts their movements. When Ensnare is triggered, one target hit by the attack becomes immobilized for a number of rounds equal to the weapon’s Ensnare rating. An immobilized target cannot perform actions. If multiple targets suffer hits from a weapon with Ensnare, the quality may be triggered multiple times, affecting a different target each time.

An Ensnared target may perform an action to attempt a Hard Athletics check on their turn to break free from the effect.

**Guided (Active)**

A weapon with the Guided quality can track opponents. The Guided quality can only be triggered if an attack misses. If Guided is triggered, the controlling character may make a combat check at the end of the round as an out-of-turn incidental. The difficulty of this combat check is Average; instead of building the ability of the pool normally, add Proficiency equal to the weapon’s Guided rating. If the check is successful, the weapon strikes the target, and the attack is resolved normally.

Guided requires 3 EFFECT to activate, unless otherwise specified in the weapon’s description. The Guided quality can activate on any subsequent combat check it makes, representing the projectile continuing to track the target.

**Inaccurate (Passive)**

Inaccurate weapons are less likely to be accurate or precise. When making an attack with an Inaccurate weapon, add 1 BANE to the check equal to the Inaccurate rating.

**Inferior (Passive)**

An Inferior item is a lackluster example of its kind, representing shoddy and poor craftsmanship. An Inferior item generates 1 BANE on all checks related to its use.

**Knockdown (Active)**

When Knockdown is triggered, one target hit by the attack is knocked prone. If multiple targets suffer hits from a weapon with Knockdown, the quality may be triggered multiple times, affecting a different target each time. Unless specified otherwise, Knockdown requires 2 EFFECT to trigger, plus one additional 1 EFFECT per silhouette of the target beyond 1.

**Limited Ammo (Passive)**

Some weapons fire particularly large or complex projectiles that cost lots of money. Other weapons are expendable weapons like grenades that, once used, are destroyed. A weapon with the Limited Ammo quality may be used to make a number of attacks equal to its Limited Ammo rating before it must be reloaded with an action. In addition, each shot expends one of a limited number of rounds of ammo; more ammo must be purchased or obtained before anyone fires the weapon again. This also applies to grenades and other “one-use” weapons that have the Limited Ammo 1 quality (here, your character is not “reloading” the grenade, but drawing another to use—mechanically, they are equivalent).

**Linked (Active)**

Some weapons are designed to fire together at the same target (turrets housing multiple guns are a good example of this). When a character fires a linked weapon, on a successful attack, the weapon deals one hit. The wielder may spend 2 EFFECT to gain an additional hit, and may do so a number of times equal to the weapon’s Linked rating. Additional hits from the Linked weapon may only be applied against the original target. Each hit deals the weapon’s base damage plus damage equal to the NET EFFECT scored on the check.

**Pierce (Passive)**

Any hits from this weapon ignore a number of points point of soak equal to the weapon’s Pierce rating. If the weapon has more ranks of Pierce than the target’s total soak, it completely ignores the target’s soak. For example, Pierce 3 against a soak of 2 ignores two points of soak, but the extra point of Pierce has no further effect.

**Prepare (Passive)**

Items with this quality require time to set up before being used. The user must perform a number of preparation actions equal to the item’s Prepare rating before using the item (if the item is a weapon, “using” it would be making attacks with the weapon). At your GM’s discretion, moving with the item, being knocked prone with the item, or other disruptions may require the user to perform the preparation actions again before using the item.

**Reinforced (Passive)**

Weapons or items with the Reinforced quality are immune to the Sunder quality. Armor with the Reinforced quality make the wearer’s soak immune to the Pierce and Breach qualities.

**Slow-Firing (Passive)**

Slow-Firing weapons tend to deal incredible damage, but need time to recharge or cool down between shots. A weapon’s Slow-Firing rating dictates the number of rounds that must pass before the weapon can be fired again after attacking. For example, a heavy 60mm cannon with Slow-Firing 2 must wait two rounds after being fired before it can be fired again.

**Stun (Active)**

A weapon with Stun can deal strain to the target. When the Stun quality is activated, it inflicts strain equal to the weapon’s Stun rating. Since this is strain, and not wound damage, it is not reduced by the target’s soak.

**Stun Damage (Passive)**

A weapon with this quality can only deal strain damage (damage applied to the target’s strain threshold). Because this is strain damage, not strain, it is still reduced by a target’s soak.

**Sunder (Active)**

When activating Sunder, the attacker chooses one item openly wielded by the target (such as a weapon, shield, or item on a belt). That item is damaged one step: to minor if undamaged, from minor to moderate, or from moderate to major. If an item already suffering major damage is the target of a successful Sunder, it is destroyed. Sunder requires 1 EFFECT to activate, and may be activated even if the attack is unsuccessful. Sunder may be activated multiple times in the same attack, but each activation must be applied to the same item, potentially taking it from undamaged to destroyed in a single attack.

**Superior (Passive)**

A Superior item is a sterling example of its kind, representing masterful craftsmanship. A Superior item generates automatic 1 EFFECT on all checks related to its use.

**Unwieldy (Passive)**

An Unwieldy weapon is a weapon that can be particularly awkward to use for those without impressive dexterity and hand-eye coordination. To wield an Unwieldy weapon properly, the character needs an Agility characteristic equal to or greater than the weapon’s Unwieldy rating. For each point of Agility by which the character is deficient, they must they suffer 1 DISADVANTAGE per point of difficiency.

**Vicious (Passive)**

When an attack with this weapon results in a Critical Injury or Hit, the character adds ten times the Vicious rating to the Critical roll. With Vicious 3, for example, you would add +30 to the resulting Critical Injury or Hit result.



#### Availability

Some items are naturally more difficult to purchase than others, depending on where your characters find themselves at any given time. Of course, some items are rare no matter where one goes, and likewise, some items are always common and inexpensive.

Availability in Sixfinity measures how difficult an item can be to find on a scale of 0–10, with 0 being the easiest to track down and 10 being the hardest. However, whether or not an item is available for purchase should never be solely a matter of rolling dice. Instead, your Game Master always has at least partial say as to whether an item is available in a certain location. Nevertheless, for simple items, rarity provides a simple way for your GM to determine whether something is available and to let you easily track items down. We suggest that you make a successful Negotiation, Streetwise, or Knowledge skill check to determine where your character can find an item.

**Availability**

| Availability | Threshold |
| ------------ | --------- |
| 0-1          | -         |
| 2-3          | 5         |
| 4-5          | 10        |
| 6-7          | 15        |
| 8-9          | 20        |
| 10           | 25        |

#### Legality

Some items are listed with an (I) or (L) as part of their Availability rating. The former refers to items that are illegal for private ownership in most places, which means they are only allowed in the possession of security, megacorporate, or government entities. The latter designation is attached to items that require a license in order to legally possess or transport them. Licenses are bought and attached to SINs (or fake SINs). The legal status of any given item is dependent on the local laws. What’s legal in the UCAS may not be legal in CalFree, or vice versa. The listings here are for the UCAS and Seattle in particular, as the UCAS has several laws (like gun possession) that vary by state.


#### Size Cost Adjustments

Most gear is built to be used by humans, or at least human-sized creatures. Elves and orks are close enough to human sizes that they can generally make this gear work for them, but it’s not as easy for dwarfs and trolls. They usually need to shop at special stores or order their gear with certain customizations made to it. To account for this, dwarfs pay a ten percent markup on all the fitted gear they purchase. This applies to items like armor and clothes Size Cost Adjustments Most gear is built to be used by humans, or at least human-sized creatures. Elves and orks are close enough to human sizes that they can generally make this gear work for them, but it’s not as easy for dwarfs and trolls. They usually need to shop at special stores or order their gear with certain customizations made to it. To account for this, dwarfs pay a ten percent markup on all the fitted gear they purchase. This applies to items like armor and clothes

**Using Unadapted Gear**

Sometimes a dwarf or a troll has to use someone else’s stuff or make do with what’s handy. Any time a dwarf or troll uses gear that is not adapted for them, they suffer a DISADVANTAGE on all actions involving that gear. This means armor doesn’t close right, guns don’t fit right, commlinks aren’t easy to use, etc.

### Encumberance

Sixfinity emphasizes sweeping stories, epic tales, and fast action. Keeping track of the weight of every piece of loose change isn’t fun, but knowing that your character has to carry a child out of a burning building is an important story element; so is having some idea of how many days’ worth of rations your character can carry while journeying in the wilderness.

In general, you and your Game Master won’t need to track your character’s encumbrance (how much they’re carrying on their person). Occasionally, however, it may play an important part in the story, and you need to know if the weight, mass, and collective bulk of the items your character is wearing inhibit their actions.

Every item of gear listed has an encumbrance value. Most items that can commonly be carried have a value between 0 and 5—from relatively light objects (such as wallets or light clothing) to heavier items (like hunting rifles or tool kits). We discuss the encumbrance value of armor in more detail later, but the one difference is that when your character is wearing armor, its encumbrance goes down. Just imagine wearing a chain-mail shirt. It’s pretty heavy, but now imagine carrying it in your hands. That’s going to be a lot more cumbersome since you can’t distribute the weight across your torso and shoulders, and you don’t have your hands free.

Encumbrance doesn’t strictly represent weight: it also represents mass, bulk, and how easy items are to carry. A well-fitting suit of plate mail adds very little encumbrance, while an armful of logs has a high encumbrance. The plate mail may weigh more, but it’s designed to be worn and fitted to a person, while a stack of unbound logs is both heavy and awkward to carry.

Small items, such as candles, most pistols, and knives, have an encumbrance value of 1 or 2. Medium items, such as rifles, a satchel of grenades, or a grappling hook and cord, have an encumbrance value of 3 or 4. Large or heavy items, such as cargo crates, light machine guns, or a heavy toolbox, are valued at 5 or 6.

If it becomes critical to the story to have more detail, ten loosely carried incidental items have an encumbrance value of 1. If they are stored in an effective manner—such as keys in a pocket or crystals in a pouch—then twenty incidental items have an encumbrance value of 1. If, for some reason, your character is unable to manage their gear in such a way, the GM may increase the items’ overall encumbrance value by several points to reflect the difficulty of managing and carrying items by less efficient means.

When carried, a living being generally has an encumbrance value of 5 plus Stamina. A typical human has a Stamina of 2, and therefore a total encumbrance value of 7.

#### Encumbrance Threshold

All characters have an encumbrance threshold of 5 plus their Stamina rating, which limits how much they can carry under normal conditions without penalty. A total encumbrance value over the threshold means the character is “encumbered,” and suffers BANE to all Agility and Stamina-based checks for every point of encumbrance over the limit. And of course, this is cumulative with any other BANE the character may be suffering.

Further, if a character is encumbered by an amount equal to or greater than their Stamina rating, they no longer earn a free maneuver each turn. The character can still perform up to two maneuvers, but each maneuver costs 2 strain. With a Stamina of 2, for example, a character would not get a free maneuver each turn if they’re carrying nine or more points of encumbrance.

#### Lifting and Carrying Excessive Encumbrance

Characters shouldn’t typically carry more than their encumbrance threshold. When necessity demands, however, they can do so for a short time (suffering the effects described above).

If your character needs to lift an object with an encumbrance value greater than their encumbrance threshold, such as an ally who has fallen off a gantry or ledge, they must make an Athletics check. The difficulty is Easy if the object’s encumbrance value is one more than your character’s encumbrance threshold. You should increase the difficulty by one for every additional point over, up to a maximum additional encumbrance of 4 and difficulty of Daunting. A character with a Stamina of 2 and a threshold of 7, for example, tries to lift a rock with an encumbrance value of 10. That’s 3 over, so the difficulty is Hard.

> EXAMPLE: LIFTING EXCESSIVE ENCUMBRANCE 
> Sara and Thrace are trying to steal a box of mining explosives as part of the plan for an upcoming heist. Thrace, who is trying to run with the box in her arms, has an encumbrance threshold of 7 (5 plus her Stamina of 2). The box’s encumbrance value is 5. Thrace is also trying to carry a shovel (3 encumbrance value) and her pistol (2 encumbrance value), so Thrace is carrying 3 over her threshold. She loses her free maneuver and adds 3 BANE to all Agility and Stamina-based checks she makes. Finally, she needs to make a Hard Athletics check just to move the crate, and since Athletics is Stamina-based, she’s going to be adding those three BANE to the check.

Additional characters may help, adding their raw Stamina to the encumbrance threshold of the character trying to lift or carry the object or objects. In the example, a person with a Stamina of 2 adds +2 to the encumbrance threshold for that specific task.

> EXAMPLE: HELPING CARRY 
> Sara, seeing that her friend Grace can’t carry a box of explosives, a shovel, and her handgun, decides to help. She grabs one end of the box, so that now the two of them are carrying it together. Sara has a Stamina of 3, so she adds 3 to Grace’s encumbrance threshold.

### Concealing Gear
We assume that your character is going to want to hide items on their person at some point. Maybe they’re concealing a weapon, or maybe they want to sneak a valuable item out of a restricted area. In any case, we do have some simple rules for hiding stuff.

Items with an encumbrance value of 1 or less can be hidden on a person easily. You don’t need to make a check for your character to hide the item. Instead, if another character tries to search your character, the searcher makes an opposed Perception check vs. your character’s Stealth. Add a BOON to the searcher’s check for every encumbrance value over 1 that is due to the hidden item. If there are multiple items, use the item with the highest encumbrance value to determine how many BOON to add.

In some cases, your character’s opponents may not specifically be checking your character for hidden items, but may just be keeping an eye out for anything odd in general (such opponents could include a sentry at a city gate, or a police officer walking the beat). In these cases, the searcher would make an opposed Vigilance check vs. Stealth instead of a Perception check.

The same rules can apply to similar situations—such as hiding a rifle (encumbrance value 4) in a dumpster full of trash. In this case, your Game Master should decide what encumbrance value of object can be hidden without being noticed, and add a BOON for every point over that.

### Item Maintenance

Invariably, items start to wear down. Rolling a Glitch may indicate a item has malfunctioned, misfired, jammed, broken down, or otherwise been rendered inoperable or impaired until it can be repaired.

All items, from low-tech weapons to more sophisticated devices, can be repaired with the Mechanics skill.

Item damage are generally classified as minor, moderate, or major. The magnitude of the required repairs indicates two things: the severity of any penalties applied to the user when trying to operate the defective item, and the difficulty rating of the necessary repairs. Repairing an item requires adequate time and tools, generally one to two hours per difficulty level. If a character attempts repairs in less time, the difficulty increases by one. Likewise, if the character lacks the proper tools, the difficulty increases by one. These factors are cumulative, so if your character tries to repair a pistol without the proper tools and in half the time it would normally take, you should increase the difficulty of the check by two.

The cost of repairs is equal to a percentage of the item’s base cost: 25% if it’s a minor repair, 50% if it’s a moderate repair, and 100% if it requires major work. Reduce the total by 10% for each Effect received on the repair check if your character is doing the work themself.

### Tracking Ammo
> I hate tracking ammo unless it matters - the Creator

Combat in our game tends to be fast-paced and narrative based, with rounds lasting an unspecified amount of “game-world” time and combat encounters usually wrapping up in a few total rounds. That narrative-driven approach also means that when your character attacks with a ranged weapon, one attack could represent a single, carefully lined up shot, or a few shots snapped off with a pistol.

All this means that we really encourage you and your GM not to worry too much about ammunition. Carefully tallying how many bullets your character has in the clip goes against the Sixfinity game experience (and the longstanding traditions of most action movies).

A better way to approach the issue of ammo is to use a Glitch generated on a combat check to make the character’s ammo run out. It’s more cinematically exciting, and certainly feels like something that would come from rolling a Glitch!

The only exception is when a weapon has the Limited Ammo quality. We reserve that quality for weapons like rocket launchers, grenades, or other weapons that very obviously can only fire once before reloading.



### Weapons

In our game, weapons have a number of distinct characteristics, which is how we define them in the game and delineate their capabilities. All weapons share the characteristic categories that we cover here.

#### Characteristics

The following are a weapon’s characteristics

**Name:** What we call the weapon

**Skill Used (Skill):** All weapons require a combat skill to operate, and this entry defines which skill the weapon requires.

Skills also can determine whether a weapon requires one or two hands to wield. The “Heavy” version of the skill means the weapon takes two hands to use, and the “Light” version of the skill means it can be used with one hand. Gunnery weapons always require two hands to use

**Base Damage (Dam):** The base damage the weapon inflicts. This is the minimum damage inflicted if the attack with this weapon hits. Each NET EFFECT the combat check generates adds one point of damage to this base damage rating.

Some weapons (including most Melee and Brawl weapons) have a “+” in front of their base damage. This means you add your character’s Stamina rating to this value.

**Critical Rating (Crit):** Indicates the number of 󲊴 required to trigger Critical Injuries using this weapon. If the weapon’s Critical rating triggers, the character rolls percentile dice on the Critical Injury table in the [Rules Section](#critical-injury). to determine the effect on the target. A Critical Injury can only be triggered on a successful hit that inflicts wounds on the target.

Some weapons and talents modify this Critical roll, potentially making a Critical Injury more or less effective. In addition, a character can only generate one Critical injury per hit on a target. However, if the check generates enough EFFECT to trigger the Critical rating of the weapon multiple times, the character can choose to add +10 to the Critical roll for each trigger after the first. More on Critical Injuries can be found on in the [Rules Section](#critical-injury).

**Range:** The range of the weapon. Range is measured in several broad range bands. Melee weapons usually require the attacker to be engaged with the target. Ranged weapons have ranges listed as short, medium, long, or extreme. See [Rules Section](#range) for more information.

**Encumbrance (Encum):** Encumbrance is an abstract measurement of how heavy and awkward something is to carry and transport. The higher the encumbrance, the more difficult the item is to carry. More details on encumbrance can be found in [Encumberance](#encumberance).

**Price:** The price of the weapon on the open market.

**Availability:** The Availability of the item, before modifiers. [Availability](#availability).

**Special:** These are the qualities or other special rules each weapon possesses. More in-depth descriptions of these qualities can be found in [Item Qualities](#item-qualities), while rules specific to a certain type of weapon are detailed in the weapon’s individual description.

#### Melee Weapon Descriptions

**BLADES**


Sharp edges provide the lethal advantage to everything with a blade. Brute force works, but elegant style is just as effective with objects honed to a razor sharpness.

**Combat axe**

Whether you’re Neal the Firefighter or Neil the Ork Barbarian, you can swing an axe for both utility and violence. The combat axe come with a single or double blade and a hardened spring-loaded thrusting point for breaking glass or providing an unpleasant surprise. In the overmuscled hands of a 2080s street warrior, this weapon can be far deadlier than a firearm.

**Forearm snap blades**

Don’t like getting implants but still want three razor sharp blades to pop out of your forearm? This is the weapon for you. The blades extend and retract through either a forearm muscle command. Either way, it takes a Minor Action. 

**Katana**

The iconic two-handed sword of the samurai is standard issue for trid-series shadowrunners. Out on the street, the deadly blade teaches lessons to those who think the trope is solely about looks.

**Knife**

A catchall term for a variety of different deadly fighting blades. The style is up to you, but the STATIS are all the same.

**Sword**

A heavy blade on a one-handed grip that comes in a variety of styles. The world’s dominant combat weapon for thousands of years until the firearm came along.

**Chainsaw**

Normally for wood. Works on people.

**CLUBS**
These do stun damage, except metal does Physical damage.

**Club**

The STATIS listed can be used for a range of objects, including an axe handle, baseball bat, crowbar, tire iron, wrench, or even a two-by-four with a couple nails in it. The price listed is for a professionally made, old-style police baton, but it would be relatively easy to find one for free in a pinch.

**Extendable baton**

This telescoping club can be extended with a wrist flick. In its retracted form, it’s easier to conceal (Concealability threshold 4 when retracted, 2 when extended). Retracting or extending it is a Minor Action. 

**Sap**

Also known as a blackjack, this is a short, flexible club or a leather-wrapped iron, lead, or sand filled sack for thumping heads. It’s designed to be concealable, often fitting in the palm of the hand (Concealability threshold 4).

**Staff**

Speak softly and carry a big stick. This is that big stick. Available in composite, hardwood, high-carbon steel, and other materials.

**Stun baton**
A riot-control staple and viewed as a symbol of corporate-government oppression, this handy electrical prod is still useful for everyone in the shadows. The stun baton holds ten charges and regains one charge per ten seconds when plugged in. 




### Thrown/Archery Weapons

Attacks using weapons in this category are made using the Athletics skill.

#### Projectile Weapon Descriptions

**BOWS**

**Bow**

Everything from the traditional longbow of fiberglass or wood to the modern compound bow. These archaic weapons aren’t common on the streets of {{YEAR OF GAME}}. They have the advantage of being hacker-proof as long as you leave off the fancy add-ons. Nocking an arrow takes a Minor Action (Ready Weapon). Bows have a rating that indicates the minimum Stamina you need to use the weapon. The weapon’s rating is also used to determine damage (maximum rating is 14). Arrows also have ratings, and they must equal or exceed that of the bow.

**Crossbow**

Modern crossbows are designed with autoloading systems, internal magazines that hold up to four bolts, and come in light, medium, and heavy designs. Light models are single-handed, while medium and heavy designs require two hands.

**Injection Arrow/Bolt**

The injection arrow or bolt causes its base damage while also delivering a payload of one dose of a drug or toxin. A successful hit must deal at least one damage after the Defense Roll. Injection arrows and bolts come at a base rating of 8. Higher-rating models are available for heavier bows, but lower-rating models aren’t sturdy enough to deliver this heavier projectile.


**Throwing Knives/Shuriken**

From stars to spikes and everything in between, these STATIS cover all the muscle-powered, small throwing weapons on the market. Up to (Agility/2) of these weapons can be readied for throwing with a Ready Weapon action. Shuriken's provide a +1 Concealability bonus





### Firearms

Leadslingers abound on the streets of {{YEAR OF GAME}} (the name remains, even though lead rounds aren’t the norm anymore). For years, the streets managed to snag and use caseless rounds in order to stay clear of the law tracking them, but recent events have led arms manufacturers (a.k.a. the megacorps) to desire a tighter leash on their shadow assets, and cased ammo is becoming the norm once again, with each casing containing a microRFID to identify the weapon and location where it was fired. The glory of watching spent shells spinning through the air is back, and so are the back-alley reloads and scrubbed slugs to keep those of us in the shadows off the radar. Weapons are chambered for cased or caseless, with caseless ammo being marginally harder to track but tougher to find on the streets.

#### Firearm Descriptions

##### **TASERS**
Pistols

Tasers accept top-mounted accessories.

**Defiance Super Shock**

This heavy-duty taser can fire up to four darts with twenty-yard-long wires. The wired connection to the battery allows for a more powerful shock but limits range. It can also be used point pointblank in Close Combat for the same damage. After a successful hit, if the target does not knock the lines free, the attacker may use a Major Action to inflict the base damage of the weapon again by opening another set of capacitors.


##### **HOLD-OUTS**
Pistols

Hold-outs can’t take accessories or modifications.

**Streetline Special**

Designed for cheap 3D nanoprinting, the Streetline Special is made of composite materials, making it harder to detect with MAD scanners (increasing the threshold to detect it by 1).

**Walther Palm Pistol**

Walther keeps the double-barreled derringer with the classic over-under design alive in the latter half of the twenty-first century with the Palm Pistol. Capable of Burst Fire by firing from both barrels at once, the limited ammo supply only offers a six-shot capacity—so tread carefully how often you go with a burst.

##### **LIGHT PISTOLS**

Light pistols can take top- and barrel-mounted accessories.

**Beretta 101T**


**Colt America L36**

A tribute to Colt’s world-class reputation, the L36 is cheap, easily concealed, and abundant on the streets. In order to be easily transferred between corporate security rookies, the weapon feafeatures an ownership swap feature that has been abused by cops and crooks alike. A perfect throwaway weapon.

**Fichetti Security 600**

Designed as a light sidearm for security forces, the thirty-round magazine allows them to miss a ton and not worry about running out of ammo. This also makes it great for deckers. The Security 600 comes with a detachable folding stock and laser sight.

**HK-227**

Heckler & Koch know how to design an SMG, since the 227 has been built off the same frame (the venerable MP5) for over a century. A top choice for corporate and military security forces, the HK–227 offers a retractable stock, integrated smartgun system, and an integral barrel- mounted silencer.

**Uzi V**

A new design for a new world. The latest model Uzi is a big market entry for Spinrad Global. The V model features an integral folding stock and builtin top-mounted laser sight.

##### **ASSAULT RIFLES**
Automatics 

Rifles can take top, barrel-, and underbarrel-mounted accessories.

**AK-97**

The AK-97 will never go out of style, especially since it still looks like its mid-twentieth-century predecessor. Built for reliability and endurance, it’s not the prettiest girl at the dance, but it can sure shake a tailfeather.

**Colt M23**

Cheap, mass-produced, and infinitely adaptable, the M23 finds its ways to the hands of everyone from gangbangers to pirates to delta-level government operators. The M23 can accept two additional underbarrel accessories for a total of three.

**FN HAR**

Fabrique Nationale is the name to fear when facing private security forces and corporate highthreat- response teams around the world. They made this weapon, which features a laser sight and a gas-vent system.

##### **Longarm Rifles**
Longarms

**Remington 900**

A high-powered bolt-action hunting rifle with a classic wooden Stamina. The base model is sold with a top-mounted imaging scope, but it cannot mount underbarrel accessories.

**Ruger 101**

Like futuretech in a hunting-rifle format, this gas-operated favorite sits in the hands of many professional hunters and hobbyists. It features a builtin imaging scope and a rigid stock with shock pad.

**Ranger Arms SM-6**

Ranger Arms knows what the SM line has always been about—silently neutralizing targets. This sniper rifle features a silencer, an imaging scope, a smartgun system, and a rigid stock with shock pad. The SM–6 carries on the line’s ability to quickly get into the action and then get out just as fast. It can fit into a standard briefcase; setting it up or breaking it down takes a Firearms + Talent (6, Major Action) Extended test. The SM-6 has dealt with the line’s fragility issues, and once put together it has no problem operating in any capacity.

**Barret Model 122**

Sometimes you need to shoot an enemy; sometimes you need to shoot an enemy through the side of an APC. The Barret Model 122 excels at tearing through metal and getting to the things it attempts to protect, ripping apart machines and vehicles with horrible tearing sounds that are music to the ears of the shooter. It has a silencer, smartgun system, and folding bipod.

##### **Shotguns**
Longarm

The STATIS for these shotguns are for normal slug rounds. Shotguns can take top, barrel, and underbarrel accessories.

**Defiance T-250**

A solid street howitzer, this semi-automatic shotgun is available in either a normal-length or short-barreled version. It is gas operated and features a secondary pump action for situations where preventing jams is more important than quickly firing a second shot (clear glitch jams with a Minor Action). The short-barreled version has a Concealability threshold of 3, DV 3.

**Remington Roomsweeper**

Double-barreled and pistol gripped makes this little beast bad news when it slips out of a pocket. If you’re not a fan of flechette shooters, load some Heavy Pistol rounds into a Roomsweeper and she shoots like a really inaccurate hand cannon.


##### **Machine Guns/Assault Cannons**
Gunnery

Machine guns come in three categories—light, medium, and heavy—that determine their Attack Ratings. All, even the “light” ones, are bulky and unwieldy. A light machine gun is bigger and heavier than most rifles, while medium machine guns and heavy machine guns can only be carried by someone with Stamina of 3+ and 5+, respectively, since they are designed as vehicle- mounted weapons. Machine guns can take top, barrel, and underbarrel accessories.

**Ingram Valiant**

The Valiant light machine gun sits in the hands of mercenary units the world over. Basic equipment includes a rigid stock with shock pad, a laser sight, and a barrel-mounted gas-vent system.

**RPK HMG**

This heavy machine gun is used by militaries across eastern Europe and Asia. Usually set up as a vehicle-mounted weapon, it comes standard with a detachable tripod, as the RPK is best fired from a prone, sitting, or kneeling position when not mounted on a vehicle.

**SPECIAL WEAPONS**

Use the Exotic Ranged Weapon skill when firing these weapons.

**Ares S-III Super Squirt**

That name is terrible. Everyone thinks the Super Squirt is some kind of water gun, but it’s basically a glorified paintball marker that fires nonlethal dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) gel packs. The DMSO forces the skin to absorb whichever chemicals the operator wishes to deliver. The attack itself causes no damage, but when the target is hit successfully, the DMSO delivers the substance directly into the target’s bloodstream as a Contact-vector toxin (see Toxins and Drugs). The Super Squirt can accept top- and underbarrel- mounted accessories.

**Parashield DART Series**

Bringing down trolls with a little plastic, steel, and chemical cocktail for decades, Parashield sets the industry standard for dart weapons. The pistol model can accept top-mounted accessories only. The rifle includes a top-mounted imaging scope and can mount top and underbarrel accessories.

##### **Launchers**

The Exotic Weapons skill is used to fire launchers, and they can take top and underbarrel accessories. Grenade launchers fire minigrenades, and missile launchers launch missiles or rockets.

**Ares Antioch II**

The Ares Thumper is a remake of the old M-72 Grenade Tube Launcher complete with two barrels. Damage is as Grenade.




### Firearm Accessesories

Most firearm accessories must be attached to a particular mount—top, barrel, underbarrel. Each mount can only hold one accessory at a time.

#### **Bipod/Tripod**

A two-legged brace extends down from the weapon, allowing it to be fired low to the ground with the user in a prone or sitting position. A bipod can be attached to the underbarrel mount of a weapon and provides an equipment ADVANTAGE to the Attack Rolls when properly deployed. Attaching a bipod takes a Major Action. Folding up or deploying a bipod is a Minor Action.

#### **Concealable holster**

A small holster worn just about anywhere on the Stamina it can’t be seen, attached with a smart adhesive. It increases the Concealability threshold of the weapon inside by 1. Only pistols and tasers fit in a concealable holster.

#### **Gas-vent system**

Gas-vent recoil compensation systems are barrel-mounted accessories that vent a weapon’s barrel gases at a specific vector to counter muzzle climb. Once installed, a gas-vent cannot be removed. Gas-vent systems remove the DISADVANTAGE from Burst Fire.

#### **Hidden arm slide**

Attached to the forearm and worn under clothing, this slide can fit a Hold-out, Light Pistol, or Taser. With a Minor Action and a specific movement, the slide moves the weapon into your hand. This makes get the weapon Ready a Minor Action.

#### **Imaging scope**

The classic top-mounted scope that includes a micro camera and vision magnification, Attachment or removal takes only a Minor Action. Having an Imaging Scope allows you to use the Take Aim Action regardless of Range.

#### **Laser sight**

This device uses a laser beam to project a visible dot (normal, low-light, or thermographic) on the target. This gives Attack Rolls ADVANTAGE 1, not cumulative with smartlink modifiers. The laser sight can be mounted as either an underbarrel mount or top mount. Activating or deactivating a laser sight is a Minor Action.

#### **Quick-draw holster**

An easy access holster designed to hold pistols and tasers. Use of the Quick-Draw holster provides a bonus Minor Action when the Quick-Draw Action is taken.

#### **Shock pads**

A shock-absorbing pad situated on the rigid stock of a rifle, shotgun, or heavy weapon. It decreases the Semi-Auto and Burst Fire Rating Penalty modifiers by 1.

#### **Silencer**

A barrel-mounted accessory for reducing the sound and flash of firing a weapon; not compatible with revolvers or shotguns. It increases the Rating on Perception tests by 2 to notice the weapon’s use or locate the weapon’s firer. Attaching or removing a silencer takes a Major Action.

#### **Smartgun system**

This is the firearm or a projectile-weapon side of the smartlink system. The system includes a small camera and range finder. It keeps track of ammunition and, through DNI, allows switching between gun modes, ejecting a clip, and firing the gun without pulling the trigger. The camera allows you to fire from cover, suffering no Attack test penalties while affected by the Cover Status. 

If you’re using a smartlink, the smartgun system gives ADVANTAGE 1 on attack rolls across all available range categories. Additionally it makes reloading 1 Action type cheaper (Major -> Minor -> Free). 

The smartgun features are accessed either by universal access port cable to an imaging device (like glasses, goggles, or a datajack for someone with cybereyes). Internal smartgun systems add 500 nuyen to the weapon price. 

An external smartgun system can be attached to the top mount or underbarrel mount with an `Mechanics + Talent (4, 1 hour)` Extended Test.

#### **Spare clip**

This is an unloaded standard magazine for a specific selected weapon.

**All Things That Go BOOM!**

Some days, you want to make things blow up real good. Okay, make that most days. Anyway, here are some ways to blow a little select portion of the world to smithereens.

**Grenades**

Grenades are small, self-contained explosive packages. Boom and shrapnel all in one neat and deadly little cluster! Minigrenades are specifically designed for use with grenade launchers, set to arm when they have traveled five yards and explode on impact or with an airburst link. The five-yard safety feature can be disabled with an `Mechanics + Talent (4, 5 Minutes) Extended Test`. Minigrenades have the same effects as standard grenades.

The damage from grenades becomes less the farther away from them you are. The DV entry for grenades lists the initial damage for those closest to the grenade, within a yard, called Ground Zero, then two categories of lesser damage for those in Close and Near Range, with the damage limited to a maximum range of the Blast STATIS. Use the `Athletics skill + Agility` when throwing grenades, or `Exotic Weapons (Launcher) + Agility` when launching a grenade from a grenade launcher. Follow the rules for Blast Attacks. Grenades and similar explosives can also be rigged with a tripwire to be set up as a basic booby trap. This requires an `Mechanics + Talent (8, 1 Major Action) Extended Test`. 
**Stun grenade**

Often called flash-bangs, these grenades explode to create a bright, loud, shocking blast that stuns and staggers anyone in their range. Along with the damage, those in the Blast of a Stun grenade suffer the Blinded I, Deafened I, and Dazed Status EFFECT.

**Flash-pak**

This is an electronic box, ten centimeters by ten centimeters on its face and two centimeters thick, containing a set of micro-flashes on each side designed to fire in random strobing sequence to confuse opponents. Anyone in the range of a flash-pak and using standard vision receives the Blinded status (p. 51) indicated in the DV chart on all tests that include vision due to the strobe effect. Using low-light causes the status to shift up one level. Flare compensation drops the status down one level. The flash-pak has ten charges and uses one charge per combat round. Plugged in, it recharges one charge every ten seconds. 

**Fragmentation**

The classic grenade, designed to launch deadly shrapnel over a large area.

**High explosive**

These grenades are designed to deliver a powerful blast but over a smaller space.

**Gas**

Any chemical or toxin payload can be chosen (Toxins and Drugs). The cloud lasts for approximately 10 combat rounds, based on the Gas Attack rules.

**Smoke/thermal smoke**

Similar to the gas grenade, a smoke grenade releases a cloud of smoke instead of toxic gas. The cloud obscures vision, inflicting the Blinded I Status for anyone acting through the smoke and Blinded II for anyone trying to act from within the smoke. The cloud lasts for approximately 10 combat rounds based on the Gas Attack rules.

**ROCKETS AND MISSILES**

| **ROCKERS/MISSILES**       | **DV GZ** | **DV CLOSE** | **DV NEAR** | **BLAST** | **AVAIL** | **COST**                         | **NOTES**                 |
| -------------------------- | --------- | ------------ | ----------- | --------- | --------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Anti-vehicle Rocket        | 12P       | 8P           | 4P          | 10m       | 5(I)      | 2,800¥                           | -                         |

| Smoke/Thermal Smoke Rocket | —         | —            | —           | —         | 4(I)      | 1,200¥                           | See rules                 |
| Missile Variant            | as Rocket | as Rocket    | as Rocket   | as Rocket | +1(I)     | As Rocket + Sensor rating x 500¥ | ADVANTAGE to Attack Rolls |

Rockets are launched projectiles with stabilizing fins, a propulsion system, and a warhead. Missiles are rockets that carry internal guidance systems, with sensor packages adding their rating to the attack roll, since they can adjust their trajectory in flight (also reflected in their Attack Rolls). Rockets and missiles are set to arm when they have traveled 10 yards from their point of origin and explode on impact or with an airburst link. This safety feature can be disabled with an `Mechanics + Talent (4, 5 Minutes) Extended Test`.

As is the case with grenades, damage from rockets and missiles decreases the farther you are from the point of impact. The ranges differ based on the weapon, as listed in the STATIS for each weapon. 

**Anti-vehicle**

AV rockets/missiles contain a shaped-charge warhead designed to burn or punch its way through a vehicle or barrier. Though the impact causes a blast, it is limited compared to that of a High-Explosive projectile. ADVANTAGE Attack Rolls against vehicles.

**Fragmentation** 

Used principally against people, the warhead discharges high-speed fragments designed to tear soft targets. These rockets/missiles are very effective against unprotected individuals, but not great against barriers, structures, and vehicles.

**High explosive** 

HE rockets/missiles are designed to do heavy damage to a small area. Their blast pattern is similar to that of a grenade, but slightly larger.


**Conventional Explosives**

| Explosives Rating | AVAIL | COST            |
| ----------------- | ----- | --------------- |
| 1–3               | 1(I)  | Rating x 10¥    |
| 4–6               | 2(I)  | Rating x 50¥    |
| 7–9               | 3(I)  | Rating x 100¥   |
| 10–12             | 4(I)  | Rating x 250¥   |
| 13–15             | 5(I)  | Rating x 500¥   |
| 16–18             | 6(I)  | Rating x 1,000¥ |
| 19–20             | 7(I)  | Rating x 5,000¥ |
| Detonator Cap     | 4(I)  | 75¥             |



Explosives are primarily used to damage structures, but metahumankind has come up with many ways to have them hurt Stamina structures. You can use the Mechanics skill to prepare explosives

A range of explosive compounds, both solid and liquid, are available to the construction industry for all their destructive needs. All explosives are bought as an Explosive Package with a set Rating that encompasses an amalgamation of their power and quantity without defining either. They cannot be combined between rating ranges due to the differences in compounds and quantities. This makes using them simpler

**Plastic**

These highly stable, moldable, and adhesive explosive compounds are military grade. They’re ideal for certain jobs, like breaching walls and are usually color-tinted to indicate the level of current needed to detonate them, from the black of magnetic- field induction to the chalky white of 440- volt industrial explosives. We say usually because some bomb makers like to dye their devices to throw off bomb techs trying to disarm their device.

**Foam**

Plastic explosives with the consistency of shaving cream, stored in an aerosol can. Perfect for spraying into crevices, and detonated the same way as regular plastic explosives.

**Detonator cap**

This detonator is inserted into a mass of explosives and set off either by a programmable timer or radio signal. Setting the timer takes a Major Action. 

### Armor
Only one type of armor can be worn at any one time with the exception of combining a shield.

#### Armor Descriptions

Due to materials advances modern armor can be lightweight, flexible, and concealable. Armor adds to Defense, and multiple items do not stack unless noted.

**Leather jacket/duster**

Synthleather is the norm for street types, and this type of jacket (waist-length to duster) never goes out of style. It even offers a modicum of protection.

**Actioneer business clothes**

This is the fancy armored suit popular among Mr. Johnsons, faces, and fixers looking for a little protection coupled with style. It features a concealable holster in the jacket.

**Armor clothing**

Lightweight ballistic weave makes these garments almost impossible to detect as armor. It doesn’t provide as much protection as real armor, but it comes in just about any style you desire.

**Armor jacket**

Available in all manner of styles, it offers good protection without catching too much attention. But don’t think of wearing one to a social event or government building.

**Armor vest**

A flexible-wrap vest designed to be worn under regular clothing without displaying any bulk.

**Chameleon suit**

A head-to-toe suit with a ruthenium polymer coating supported by a sensor suite, allowing it to scan its surroundings and replicate the images at the proper perspectives. You gain a bonus Edge when performing Stealth tests to hide while wearing an active suit.

**Lined coat**

This cowboy-style duster has been consistently popular on the mean streets of the world’s sprawls for the past fifty years. Besides being protective, the armored trenchcoat provides a bonus Edge against tests to spot items hidden underneath.

**Urban Explorer jumpsuit**

Designed for couriers, athletes, and freerunners, this is the armored version of “flats” but available in a stupid array of styles. Because they’re so hip, these jumpsuits include a built-in music player and biomonitor.


##### ARMOR MODIFICATIONS

Armor can be upgraded with a range of modifications. The Capacity of a piece of armor is listed in the Armor Table. Armor modifications have a Capacity costs equal to their rating; the Capacity cost determines how much you can stuff into a single piece of armor.

**Chemical Protection**

This modification protects the wearer against Contact-vector chemical attacks (Toxins and Drugs, p. 121). The special coating neutralizes the Corrosive status for a number of attacks equal to its rating.

**Chemical Seal**

Available only with full Stamina armor, the chemical seal is an airtight environmental control that takes a Major Action to activate. It prevents the effects of all statuses connected to Contact- and Inhalation- vector chemicals but can only be used for a total of an hour at a time due to the air supply. It also neutralizes the Corrosive status six times before it’s built in chemical protection is worn away and the armor no longer has chemical seal protection.

**Cold Resistance**

Thermal fibers and heat-retentive materials protect the wearer. The armor cancels the Chilled status a number of times equal to its rating. Once it has resisted the Chilled status a number of times equal to its rating, it is worn away, and the armor no longer has cold resistance.

**Fire Resistance**

Fire-retardant, nonflammable materials protect the wearer. The armor cancels the Burning status a number of times equal to its rating. Past that point, it is worn away, and the armor no longer has fire resistance.

**Electricity Resistance**

Electrical insulation and non-conductive materials protect the wearer. The armor cancels the Zapped status a number of times equal to its rating. Once it has been Zapped a number of times equal to its rating, it is worn away, and the armor no longer has electricity resistance.

#### Helmets & Shields

Helmets come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes and protect your noggin from trauma. Helmets have Capacity that is usable for accessories such as trode nets and vision enhancements.

**Riot shield**

The clear plasteel cousin of the ballistic shield, this one adds an electricity attack option. Use the Close Combat skill for the attack and attack STATIS of a Stun Baton. The taser shield holds 10 charges; when attached to a power point, it regains one charge per 10 seconds.


### ELECTRONICS


### Cyberdecks

When the corps cracked down on the Matrix, working hard to prevent illicit use of their pretty new system, the cyberdeck re-emerged as the tool for messing with innards of the Matrix. They are powerful devices in the hands of a skilled decker. The newest models look something like medieval bracers, only less bulky. They’re worn on the wrist and can project keyboards (or whatever interface the user prefers) onto the user’s arm, a nearby surface, or just the air around them. Some models have screens; most don’t. They tend to look like a block with a series of ports For more information about them, see Devices.

## Chapter 8: Combat

Combat Rating By Rating

1. Establish Positions
2. Determine Initiative
3. Take Turns
4. Move to next Round

### Initiative

Initiative = Agility + (Potential XD6) (+ extra +XD12 from augmentations). Order = highest to lowest Initiative total.

**Initiative Table**

| Initiative Type | Initiative Test                             |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Personal Combat | Agility + (Potential XD6) (+XD12 from gear) |


#### Timed Items & Initiative

Unless the item lets you set a timer (in which case the player chooses when), these items go off at the end of the player’s turn. If armed and thrown/placed this turn, resolve at end of this turn; otherwise at the owner’s next end of turn.

### Movement and Position

In combat, characters and NPCs are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand.

Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can constitute your entire move. However you're moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.

#### Breaking Up Your Move

You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after another action. For example, if you have a speed of 10 yards, you can move 2 yards, take your action, and then move 8 yards.

#### Difficult Terrain

Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains.

Furniture-strewn offices, rubble filled streets, treacherous staircases—the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.

Every yard of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra yard. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.

Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.

#### Being Prone

Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are prone, a condition described in the appendix.

You can drop prone without using any of your speed. Standing up takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to one third your speed. For example, if your speed is 10 yards, you must spend 3 yards of movement to stand up. You can't stand up if you don't have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.

To move while prone, you must crawl or use magic. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra yard. Crawling 1 yard in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 yards of movement.

#### Moving around Other Creatures

You can move through a nonhostile creature's space. In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature's space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature's space is difficult terrain for you.

Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can't willingly end your move in its space.

If you leave a hostile creature's reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained later in the chapter.


### Action In Combat

The Action economy of Sixfinity is more structured than the economy in Shadowrun. 

When the action picks up and the game moves into taking turns in initiative order, it’s good to know how much time is passing and what you can do in that time.

When you get to take a turn and describe what your character is doing, your actions are contained in a combat round. A combat round lasts for about three seconds of in-universe time. Everyone, player characters and non-player characters alike, take a single player turn within that round.

Each combat round, you gain an action allotment that you use on your player turn. Actions come in two categories: Minor and Major. The basic action allotment for each character is 1 Minor Action and 1 Major Action per combat round. Players get 1 additional Minor Action for every Initiative Die they have. Players can trade Minor and Major Actions, using a Major Action to perform a Minor Action or using 4 Minor Actions to perform a Major Action (possibly providing an extra attack in a single player turn). Each action has a note next to it indicating when it can be performed; this is either Initiative (I) or Anytime (A). Initiative Actions can only be performed on the character’s player turn during an initiative round, while Anytime Actions can be used at any time. Note, though, that in order to perform an Anytime Action, you must have an Action left. If you spent them all on your turn, you can’t use one later. So sometimes it pays to save an action for later in the round if you act early. Note that actions cannot be carried from one round to another unless that is specifically allowed in a rule.

Along with these actions, enough words can be spoken or conversation can be shared to fill three seconds; if there is any doubt about the amount of words that can be said, time it!

Every **combat round** a character gets:
- 1 Major Action and 1 Minor Action



#### Minor Actions
These actions usually take only a small amount of focus or a quick and simple thought or movement. A key point among Minor Actions is that they generally do not require a test of any kind. That doesn’t mean in truly dire situations where the pressure is on that the gamemaster can’t ask for a test to be made—it just means that usually, as long as you have the action available, you can perform the task by simply declaring the use of it.

- Move (I) – Move up to 10y. (1 per turn.)
- Take Cover (I) – Gain Cover I–IV if terrain allows. Increases rating to be hit by 1 per Cover Rating
- Take Aim (I) – +1 Bonus EFFECT (bankable; max = Tenacity; once per round). 
- Ready/Draw/Sheathe (I) – Ready or stow a weapon.
- Reload (I) – Reload weapon. (Smartlink reduces friction; same action.)
- Operate Device (A) – Toggle/switch a device via DNI or manual.
- Command Minion (I) – Command one spirit/drone; RCC can broadcast a shared command to many.
- Defensive Agility (A) – Choose Block (melee: add Armed/Unarmed) or Dodge (ranged: add Athletics) to one Defense roll.
  - Applies to a single incoming attack; expires afterward.
- Opportunity Attack (A) – Melee OA when a hostile leaves your reach.
- Stand/Prone (I) – Drop prone or stand up.

##### Move (I)

**EFFECT:** Move up to **10 yards**.
**Limits:** You can take **only one Move** per turn. You may break up movement before/after other actions. Difficult terrain costs +1 yard per yard. Moving through a hostile’s space requires the size exception and counts as difficult terrain.
**Triggers:** Leaving a hostile creature’s reach **provokes an Opportunity Attack**.

##### Take Cover (I)

**EFFECT:** If suitable terrain exists, gain **Cover I–IV** (GM sets level based on how much of you is obscured: ¼, ½, ¾, full). Each level grants **A rating up in difficulty to be hit**.
**Constraints:** Attacking from **Cover IV** imposes **DISADVANTAGE** to your attack. While attacking from any Cover.

##### Take Aim (I)

**EFFECT:** Gain **+1 Bonus EFFECT** on your **next** attack. You can **bank** this; it persists round to round until used or lost.
**Limits:** Maximum banked Aim bonus = your **Tenacity**. You can Take Aim **once per round**. If you take a turn without **Take Aim** or **Attack**, you lose all banked Aim. You can’t bank Aim while Prone behind Cover IV.
**Scopes/Vision:** If using a scope or vision magnification, the **first Take Aim** enables the device (no extra bonus), subsequent Aims stack as normal.

##### Ready / Draw / Sheathe (I)

**EFFECT:** Ready or stow a weapon or handheld item.
**Notes:** If you have **Quick Draw** (gear/aug/quality), you may Ready a pistol-sized or small thrown weapon as part of this action and **immediately Attack** this turn. Very small items can be Readied in bunches (up to **Agility** to off-hand) at GM discretion.

##### Reload (I)

**EFFECT:** Reload a weapon to full capacity if you have ammo available.

Refer to the Fire Modes section in Equipment if you need to know what kind of Action your weapon reloads.

##### Operate Device (A)

**EFFECT:** **Toggle/switch** a simple function on a device you can physically access or that’s connected via **DNI** (e.g., change smartgun fire mode, engage safety, open/close a maglock, switch commlink mode, turn cyberware on/off).
**Notes:** Complex multi-step interactions use **Operate Complex Device (Major)**.

##### Command Minion (I)

**EFFECT:** Issue **one clear command** to **one** spirit or drone under your control.
**RCC Broadcast:** With an RCC, you may issue the **same command** to **all linked drones** with a single Command Minion. Different commands require additional uses.
**Dismiss:** Dismissing a spirit is also done with this action.

##### Defensive Agility (A)

**Trigger:** When you are targeted by an attack, **before** the Defense roll is made.
**EFFECT (choose one):**

* **Block (melee):** Add your **Armed or Unarmed Combat** skill to this **one** Defense test.
* **Dodge (ranged):** Add your **Athletics** skill to this **one** Defense test.
* **Duration:** Applies to a **single** incoming attack; expires afterward.

##### Opportunity Attack (A)

**Trigger:** A hostile creature **leaves your reach** by moving away (teleports and forced movement do not trigger unless stated).
**EFFECT:** Make **one melee Attack** against the triggering target.
**Limits:** You can make one Opportunity Attack per round; it costs no action.

##### Stand / Prone (I)

**EFFECT:** **Drop Prone** or **stand up**.
**Movement:** Standing costs **one third** of your speed (round up); if you lack enough movement remaining this turn, you can’t stand. Prone movement is crawling (each yard costs +1 yard; stacks with difficult terrain).
**Status:** Applies/removes the **Prone** status.

#### Major Actions

These actions take a bit more concentration or time to complete. Several involve a test of some kind, but some simply occur as long as you have the Action available. Just like Minor Actions, if there is no test involved but the gamemaster feels the pressure is on and one should be required, they have final say in the matter.

- Attack (I) – Melee or Ranged. (Rider: Multiple Attacks by splitting penalties across targets.)
- Use Skill (I) – Any non-attack skill use (includes quick search/assess).
- Cast Spell (I) – Cast (healing/damage/utility). Counterspell timing lives in Magic.
- Summon/Banish (I) – Summon a spirit or banish one.
- Full Defense (A) – Add Tenacity to all Defense tests until your next turn.
- Operate Complex Device (I) – Multi-step interaction with non-trivial gear/rigging; includes Rigger Jump-In.
- Interact (I) – Safely pick up/put down/manipulate objects not covered by Ready.

##### Attack (I)

**EFFECT:** Make a **melee or ranged** attack.
**Roll:**

* **Ranged:** `STATIS Dice + (Firearms/Archery/Throwing Weapons/Gunnery) + misc` vs target’s Rating Difficulty.
* **Melee:** `STATIS Dice + (Armed Combat/Unarmed Combat) + misc` vs target’s Rating Difficulty.
  **Hit:** Deal **Damage Value = Weapon Damage + NET EFFECT**; apply any damage-type riders (e.g., Burning).
  **Rider – Multiple Attacks:** You may attack **multiple targets** you can legally threaten (ammo/reach/arc permitting). Each additional attack raises the Rating by 1 per attack. Resolve each attack separately. NET EFFECT is calculated per target.

##### Use Skill (I)

**EFFECT:** Attempt a **non-attack** task that requires a skill test during combat (e.g., hack a door panel, stabilize a teammate, force a door, shove/grapple per table’s combat actions, scan a room).
**Roll:** `Linked STATIS Dice + Skill (+ misc)` vs GM-set Threshold Rating or opposed roll.
**Notes:** This is your catch-all “do a thing” action in combat time. Tasks that are just a toggle use **Operate Device (Minor)**.

##### Cast Spell (I)

**EFFECT:** Cast a spell (damage, heal, utility).
**Roll:** As defined in **Magic** (typically `Sorcery + (Potential XD6)`). Apply drain, effects, and riders per spell.
**Counterspell:** Reactions to spells (Counterspell) are handled in the **Magic** chapter and may be Anytime where appropriate.

##### Summon / Banish (I)

**EFFECT:**

* **Summon:** Call a spirit to your side (consumes services as defined in Magic).
* **Banish:** Attempt to dismiss or disrupt a spirit.
  **Roll:** As defined in **Magic** (opposed by spirit as appropriate).
  **Control:** Issuing orders after summoning uses **Command Minion (Minor)**.

##### Full Defense (A)

**Timing:** Declare **anytime**; takes effect immediately.
**EFFECT:** Same as Minor **Defensive Action** but lasts **until your next turn**.
**Limits:** You can only use Full Defense **once per round**. Does not stack with **Defensive Action**

##### Operate Complex Device (I)

**EFFECT:** Perform a **multi-step** or **precision** interaction with complex gear/vehicles/systems that goes beyond a simple toggle (e.g., **Rigger Jump-In** to a drone/vehicle, configure fire-control groups, perform a short hacking sequence on a door while under fire, calibrate a medkit to a patient).
**Roll:** Usually `Talent + relevant skill` vs Threshold Rating or opposed; see specific subsystem (Matrix/Rigging/Medtech).
**Notes:** Once jumped-in, continued piloting/commanding typically uses **Command Minion (Minor)** or further **Operate Complex Device** at GM discretion.

##### Interact (I)

**EFFECT:** Safely **pick up**, **put down**, **stow**, **retrieve**, or otherwise manipulate objects not covered by **Ready/Draw/Sheathe** (e.g., holster one weapon while picking up a dropped one, carefully place a grenade, sling a Stamina over your shoulder, open/close a heavy door, apply a stim patch).
**Roll:** Usually none; the GM may call for a test if time pressure, risk, or precision matters.
**Notes:** Use this when the fiction calls for handling objects with care or when multiple items are involved.

### Combat Round

A combat round is approximately 3 seconds long in the game world. During a single combat round, each participant gets an allotment of Actions to use on or around their player turn. The basic Action allotment for each character is 1 Minor Action and 1 Major Action per combat round. Players get 1 additional Minor Action for every Initiative Die they have.

Actions can be traded between Minor and Major, but there are restrictions. A Major Action can be used to perform a Minor Action, simple as that. A character can also trade 4 Minor Actions to perform 1 Major Action.

Characters may never start a player turn with more than 5 Minor Actions. If they would have earned more through any circumstances, that number is reduced to 5.

#### Attacks

Players roll all the dice in Sixfinity. 

Ranged Attack: `Potential XD6 + Proficiency + (Firearms/Archery/Throwing Weapons/Gunnery) + misc` vs target’s Rating Difficulty.

Melee Attack: `Potential XD6 + Proficiency + (Armed Combat/Unarmed Combat) + misc` vs target’s Rating Difficulty.

When attacked by an enemy: `Potential XD6 + Proficiency Agility` vs attacker's Rating Difficulty. 

### Damage

Involved as they are in an illegal and often hazardous line of work, runners get hurt and get hurt often. What kind of damage, how bad an injury is, and how much it affects the character vary greatly depending on the situation.

Damage is calculated based on the weapon, spell, effect in Physical or Stun. You deduct that from your Health. 

Damage Value (DV) = Weapon Damage + NET EFFECT

Apply damage type riders (e.g., Burning, Zapped) after DV is applied.

#### Types of Injury

Damage in Sixfinity is defined as Physical or Stun. Each type of damage is tracked on a separate Condition Monitor.

##### Physical Damage

Physical damage, the most dangerous type, is the kind done by guns, explosions, most melee weapons, and many magic spells. Weapons that inflict Physical damage have the letter “P” following their Damage Value. Physical damage takes a longer time to heal.

##### Stun Damage

Stun damage—bruising, muscle fatigue, and the like— is the kind done by fists, kicks, blunt weapons, stun rounds, shock weapons, concussion grenades, and some magic spells. If something does Stun damage, the letter “S” follows the Damage Value. Stun damage takes a shorter time to heal.

### Healing

We’ve explained to you how to put the hurt on, so now let’s talk about getting the hurt off. Healing in Shadowrun is a mix of in-the-field first aid, miraculous magic, futuristic tech, and heroic speeds of natural recovery. Getting back in the fight is a lot more fun than lying in a hospital bed for weeks or months.

The first thing to cover is the order of operations for healing. Do you need to apply first aid before magic or after? Can you magically heal someone who’s already been treated by a medkit? The answer is simple: The order doesn’t matter, except that Overflow damage heals first. Every character gets multiple chances to get patched up before they’re stuck carrying around their injuries for days. The key here is how soon each needs to be applied. Details are under each description below.

#### First Aid
- Medicine + Talent (5 - Essence)

As implied by the name, this is probably the first aid you should apply because it has the narrowest window. After the end of a combat encounter in which a character was injured, they have 1 minute (20 combat rounds if another fight kicks off) to receive First Aid. To apply First Aid, a character needs the right tools for the job, in this case a first aid kit. Any test made without a kit suffers a DISADVANTAGE, and no Edge can be spent on the test.

Make a `Medicine + Talent test against a threshold equal to 5 – target’s Essence`. If the target is one-hundred-percent natural, the healer actually gets an automatic +1 EFFECT added to what they roll. This represents the difficulty of repairing someone who has metal parts as well as those with organs not normally found in average people. EFFECT is used to heal 3 points ofStun Damage (**not including drain**) per effect or 3 points ofPhysical Damage or 2 points of Overflow per effect. Drain cannot be healed with First Aid. A character can receive First Aid only once for any single set of injuries.

#### Medkit
- Medicine + Talent (5 - Essence)

Medkits are more detailed. The patient must be connected to medkit monitors and diagnosed, after which they receive injections and IVs. After the end of a combat encounter in which a character is injured, they have one hour to be connected to a medkit or get medical attention from a trained professional with a medkit. If they wait beyond this period, a medkit will not help them. It takes one minute to hook up the patient, get the medkit to spit out a diagnosis, and begin treatment. The healing process takes one minute per 4 points healed (so, if the process is interrupted, you know how much they were patched up). Each time a medkit is used, it consumes one batch of supplies. Treatment cannot be attempted if no medkit supplies remain.

Make a `Medicine/Medkit Rating + Talent test against a threshold of 5 – target’s Essence`. If the target is one-hundred-percent natural, the healer gets an automatic +1 EFFECT added to their roll. Like First Aid, this fixes biological material, not machinery. EFFECT is used to heal 3 points ofStun, Physical, or Overflow Damage per EFFECT, but not damage from drain.

There is a limit to receiving a medkit treatment. A character can only benefit from a medkit once for any single set of injuries.

#### Magic
- Sorcery + Magic (Potential XD6) (using Healing or similar spell)

The wonders of magic are many and great. Healing spells are some of the most commonly studied magics for those working on the streets. Some use their skills to earn a little extra cash patching up gangers; others serve on a runner team, keeping their partners fighting when the bullets start finding their targets. Those with hearts of gold work as regular street healers to give the denizens of the barrens a chance at a healthy life.

The good news about magical healing is it works at the speed of a spell—once the spell is cast, the effect takes hold.

Healing magic can mend both Physical and Stun injuries, but not those caused by Drain. The leftover taint of wearisome mana prevents the healing magics from connecting to that damaged tissue to heal it. As with medkits, NET EFFECT can be used to heal 3 points ofStun, Physical, or Overflow Damage per EFFECT. For more information on casting healing spells, see Magic.

A character can be healed by Magic only once for any single set of injuries.

#### Natural Recovery/Medical Assistance (Varies by damage type)

After all other options have been used, if injury remains, it’s all about rest and possibly some help from a trained medical professional (or just your team medic). Rest is simply defined as not engaging in any strenuous physical or mental activity—essentially, anything that involves a dice roll would break your rest. Medical attention offers a bonus to the recovery roll. If any person trained in Medicine is watching over the character for at least half of their rest period, the wounded individual gains 2 Bonus EFFECT to the healing tests defined below.

To heal Physical Damage, roll `Stamina (1)` once per day. Each EFFECT heals 3 points of Physical Damage after that day of rest.

To heal Stun Damage, roll `Tenacity (1)` once per hour. Each hit heals 3 points of Stun Damage after that hour of rest. A full 8 hour (Long Rest) rest will recover all lost Stun Health.

#### Overflow & Dying

Sometimes a hit brings you closer to death than you ever really want to be, and you’ve got some Damage Overflow to recover. These points are healed just like Physical Damage and need to be healed before the character can return to the land of the conscious. Note that if a character receives exceeeds their Overflow damage, they are dead and gone, beyond the reach of any kind of healing.

### Status List
The different statuses used in Shadowrun, Sixth World are described below.


#### Blinded I, II, III

Whether it’s flashing lights, some specialized chemical, or the pure force of magic, there are plenty of ways to make it impossible for shadowrunners to see. For the first two levels of this status, characters take a DISADVANTAGE per level to all tests involving visibility. At the third level, characters automatically fail any tests involving visibility.

#### Burning #

The Burning status is the result of being hit with a flame-based attack. Once the initial blow has done its damage, you have to deal with the continuing heat and flames, and the parts of yourself that may be on fire. 

The status should be noted with a number that indicates the amount of Physical damage the character must resist each round while the status exists. There are multiple ways to remove this status. You can spend a Major Action and roll an `Agility + Agility (2) test`; success means the fire is out and the status is removed. You can also jump into water to remove the status without a roll.

If you gain the Wet and/or Chilled statuses, the Burning status is canceled. Similarly, gaining the Burning status cancels the Wet or Chilled status.

#### Charmed
- A charmed creature can’t attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.
- The charmer has ADVANTAGE on any test to interact socially with the creature.

#### Chilled

When you are truly, damagingly cold, it seeps into your bones and won’t let go, and you can’t move as smoothly and nimbly as you would like. When you are Chilled, you get –4 to your Initiative Score and DISADVANTAGE to all tests. This status cancels and is canceled by the Burning status.

#### Confused #

Colors, patterns, and weird ideas swirl around your head, keeping you from being able to focus, which makes your actions uncoordinated and awkward. The number after the status acts as a rating penalty on any test you take.

#### Corrosive #

Acids, bases, and other caustics eat into your flesh and don’t stop. The ongoing damage from these chemicals is noted with the Corrosive status, which comes with a number after it to denote how much damage the ongoing effect inflicts. 

This status can be removed with certain gear (like baking soda for acids!) and equipment. The Wet status does not necessarily remove it, as some chemicals continue burning the skin even after contact with water. The gamemaster can determine when enough water has been applied to remove the chemical in question.

#### Cover I, II, III, IV

Whether you hide behind a wall, a dumpster, or a Stamina, Cover is protection from hostile fire. It comes at four levels, indicating how much of a character’s Stamina is protected (one-quarter, onehalf, three quarters, or all). A character in Cover gets a an ADVANTAGE to their to hit Rating per level. Attacking from Cover requires an extra Minor Action in order to get clear enough to take a shot, imposes a DISADVANTAGE penalty to your attack at Cover IV.

#### Dazed

One too many thumps to the head, or maybe the solar plexus, leaves the character woozy and unable to act with their normal alacrity. The character reduces their Initiative Score by –4, and they cannot gain or spend Edge as long as they have this Status.

#### Deafened I, II, III

Whether you heard a sudden, hugely loud clap, or someone stuffed your ears full of cotton-like mana, sound waves are not getting through so that your brain can tell you what they mean. For the first two levels of this status, characters take a DISADVANTAGE penalty per level to all tests involving hearing. At the third level, characters automatically fail any tests involving hearing.

#### Fatigued I, II, III

At its top level, this status is that dreamlike weariness, where your legs are lead and just will. Not. Move. Characters with this status take a DISADVANTAGE per level to all tests. Characters move at 5 yards per turn instead of 10 for walking, and 10 instead of 15 for sprinting.

#### Frightened

Something has hit your lizard brain, and rational thought flees. All you have left is fear. Characters take a two rating penalty to any tests directed to or defending against the source of the effect. They also cannot move toward the source of their fear. 

#### Hazed

Something has messed up your connection to the astral world, leaving that realm out of your reach. Or worse, if you were already astral, you’re stuck there. A character with this status is unable to move between the astral plane and the physical world. They cannot astrally project or manifest. They may still perceive astrally.

#### Hobbled

Any movement on foot—Move or Stand/Prone—costs double distance (round up).

#### Immobilized

Just what it sounds like! Characters with this status cannot move, though they can take any actions that will function with their feet stuck to the ground. They take a DISADVANTAGE on all attack rolls and cannot add Agility to Defense rolls.

#### Incapacitated
- An incapacitated creature can’t take actions or reactions.

#### Invisible #

The go-to status for sneak thieves. Characters are less visible to living and sentient beings. The number after the status indicates the threshold rating people must hit on a Perception test to notice the character with this status. Cameras and other inorganic methods of visibility detection can see someone with this status as normal.

#### Invisible (Improved) #

The same as Invisibility, but it also affects camera and other technological ways of seeing.

#### Nauseated

Your stomach heaves, your head spins, and you have trouble thinking about anything other than not throwing up. Characters must pass a `Stamina (2)` test at the start of a combat round. If they fail, they cannot take an action that round. If they succeed, they can act, but they lose a Minor Action.

#### Panicked

The drek has hit the fan, and it has splattered everywhere, and you have lost the ability to act in any sort of a coherent fashion. Characters with this status cannot act except to avoid the condition that is causing the Panicked effect.

#### Petrified

There is a good reason why you don’t want to be in the wrong end of a basilisk stare, and this is it. The character is essentially turned into solid material. They cannot take any actions, and they get a +10 Defense Rating (reducing their damage by 10). This cancels any other damaging statuses the character may have been experiencing.

#### Poisoned #

Something wrong has gotten into the character’s Stamina, and it’s going to mess them up until it works its way through. This status has a damage code after it, with a number and an indication for either Physical or Stun damage. At the end of each combat round when this status exists, the character must take the damage. The damage decreases by 1 each round. Antidotes, both physical and magical, can remove this status.

#### Prone

One of the classics—you drop to the ground to get a stable shot and make yourself tougher to shoot. The character’s movement rate is reduced to 2 yards and they cannot Move more than once per turn while Prone. They get ADVANTAGE Defense vs. ranged and DISADVANTAGE Defense to melee. ADVANTAGE attack rolls with firearms and projectile weapons (not bows)..

#### Silent #

Your ability to make noise is greatly hindered. The number after the status indicates the threshold rating people must hit on a Perception test to hear the character with this status. Microphones and other inorganic methods of audio detection can pick up sounds of someone with this status as normal.

#### Silent (Improved) #
The same as Silent, except microphones and other forms of technology are also affected.

#### Stunned
- A stunned creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can’t move, and can speak only falteringly.
- The creature automatically DISADVANTAGE to the Defense roll

#### Unconscious
- An Unconscious character is Incapacitated, can’t move or speak, and is unaware of their surroundings.
- The character drops whatever they’re holding and falls Prone.
- Any attack that hits the character is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet.

#### Wet

Whether it’s a pouring rain, a sudden wave, or the efforts of a rampaging water spirit, you are soaked from head to toe. You take double damage from cold and electricity damage. Cancels the Burning status, is canceled by the Burning status, and may affect the Corrosive status.

#### Zapped

A jolt of electrical power has hit you, leaving you fried and scattered. Your muscles aren’t working quite right, either. Suffer –2 Initiative, cannot Take Aim this round., and DISADVANTAGE to all actions for 2 rounds.

### Damage Types

Certain weapons and attacks deliver damage besides simple kinetic energy transfer. These forms of attacks, such as flamethrowers, fireballs, lightning bolts, tasers, and toxic waves to name a few, usually have a secondary and/or extended Status effect beyond the initial attack and damage result.

#### Electricity

Getting zapped not only hurts, but it also seizes muscles and leaves a victim shaky from muscle tremors. If a character shakes off the damage, they’re all good, but if any damage gets through (≥1), apply Zapped for 2 rounds.

#### Chemical (acids, bases, caustics, etc.) 

Attacks that involve corrosive chemicals—acids, bases, caustics, toxins, etc.—tend to stick around and cause damage on subsequent rounds. Chemical attacks add the Corrosive status. Additionally, if the modified Damage Value of an attack exceeds the Armor of the target, the Defense boost from that piece of armor is permanently decreased by one after the attack is resolved.

#### Cold

No one likes being cold. The shakes, chattering teeth, hypothermia, and tissue damage are just a few reasons your life will be harder after you get hit by a cold-based attack. Taking damage from an attack with a Cold damage type inflicts the Chilled status for 3 combat rounds. Lastly, if the modified Damage Value of an attack exceeds the Armor of the target, the Defense boost from that piece of armor is permanently decreased by one after the attack is resolved.

#### Fire

Once you’re hit by an attack that involves fire, the fire ignites flammable objects, including you. This effect means the fire burns for several rounds after the first. Taking damage from an attack with a Fire damage type inflicts the Burning status.

Gamemaster note: The damage and duration are subject to your discretion if the target has some mitigating circumstance. If they’re covered in oil or wearing a lot of loose-fitting cloth, it may last longer, cause more damage, or require a higher threshold to extinguish.


## Chapter 9: Magic

### Spells

When people think of magic, they tend to think of spells first. Spells are the process that makes magic happen, the channeling of magic into an effect that stops the world in its tracks— or keeps you from being noticed at all. This is how they work.

### Learning Spells

New spells, rituals, or alchemical preparations can be learned by studying spell formulae or finding some mentor (either a spirit or another Awakened individual) to teach you. Some magicians may be lucky enough to have a library of collected scrolls and grimoires passed down from previous generations. They also could have an Awakened family member teach them a new spell. For the rest of the Awakened, there are online communities such as SpellSource and Magicknet that hold collections of formulae submitted from various traditions. These networks are generally supported by one or more corporations, meaning that in order to use it, you’ll need have a legal SIN and a license to practice magic. Or good fakes. Established magicians sometimes work in the grey area of teaching unlicensed magicians, picking up a little extra nuyen by passing on knowledge to someone not quite as experienced.

Once you have access to a magical lodge and either a formula or a teacher for the spell you want, you’re ready to try to learn the spell. Make a Learning test, which is a (Sorcery or Enchanting, depending on the type of formula) + Intuition test. The time you need to learn the spell is equal to twelve days divided by the number of hits you get. If you have a teacher, they can make an Instruction test (p. 96) to add extra dice to your Learning test. At the end of the study time, spend 5 Karma to learn the formula for the spell, ritual, or alchemical preparation.

All injury modifiers apply, as do distractions from sustaining spells, poor conditions, and so forth. If your formula or teacher is of a different tradition than you, you take a –4 penalty to the Learning test.

While learning the spell, you must devote eight hours of each day to studying it, otherwise you fail and must start all over. If you get no hits on the Learning test, you fail. If you do end up failing, no Karma is spent, but any money you spent on instruction is gone.

### Casting Spells

Casting a spell has three primary steps (note that Combat spells add a step before these three):

1. Adjust the spell;
2. Roll a Spellcasting test (Sorcery + Magic); and
3. Deal with drain.

#### Adjust the spell

The maximum number of adjustments that can be made is equal to Magic or Sorcery, whichever is higher.

**Amp Up**: This is for Combat spells only. For each point of base damage the caster wants to add to a Combat spell, increase the drain of that casting by 1. Its 1 for 1.

**Increase Area**: Area-effect spells have a base effect of a sphere with a two-yard radius. For each increase of 2 yards in the radius of the area of effect, increase the drain of the casting by 1.

**Shift Area**: This can only be done with certain area-effect spells. The caster can shift the area a sustained spell is affecting to another area within spell range. Spells that can have the area shifted are noted in the spell description. This requires a Minor Action and can be done any time. It does not cause drain.

#### Roll the Spellcasting test

The Spellcasting test is `Sorcery + Magic`; the rating needed is described in the Spell Descriptions.

For example to cast Acid Stream. You have a Magic 6. Sorcery 6. You are going to use Amp Up to get 4 extra damage. Increasing the Drain Value by 4. 

You roll `Potential XD6 + Proficiency 6 + 6` the enemy you are fighting is a Rating 6 enemy so you need an 18.

You absolutely need to get this so you spend an Edge. You roll a 4 on your D6 and a 5 on your Edge dice. So your total is a 21. You met a Rating 7, so you have a NET EFFECT of 1. You will do 5 Damage. And applies Corrosive 5 for 5 rounds decreasing 1 point per round. 

#### Deal with drain

Each spell has a Drain Value, which may be increased by any adjustments the caster makes. The caster rolls `Tenacity + their tradition attribute Talent for hermetic mages, Savvy for shamans`—and compares the rating to the Drain Value of the cast spell. If the total rating achieved is equal to or greater than the Drain Value, the drain has no effect. If the Drain Value is higher than the rating, the caster experiences Stun damage equal to the difference between rating and Drain Value. Armor has no effect on drain damage; if the damage after the resistance test is higher than the caster’s Magic, the damage becomes Physical. Drain damage cannot be healed by magic or medkits.

Using the above example. 

The Drain Value of Acid Stream is 5.
Since you used Amp Up it will add 4 to the Drain Value making it 9.

Your Drain Value is 5 + 4 for a total of 9. You have a Tenacity of 5 and a Talent of 5. So you roll `Potential XD6 + Proficiency 5 + 5` and need a Rating of 9 with a Threshold of 27. You roll a 6 for a total of 16. That gives you an EFFECT of 5 so you will take 4 Stun Damage for casting this spell. You would not be able to do this forever but you can dish it out when you need to.

#### Spell Descriptions

Shadowrun spells have the following elements:

**Category**: Spells in Shadowrun are divided into five categories: Combat, Detection, Health, Illusion, and Manipulation. Spells are listed according to their category, since there are commonalities throughout the category.

**Range**: This is either Touch, meaning the target needs to be touched; LOS, meaning the caster needs a physical sight line to the target (optical lenses such as binoculars count as physical line of sight; magical effects and digitized images such as thermographic goggles do not); LOS(A) means the spell has a line of sight range and also has an area effect, which starts at a two-yard-radius sphere; Special means the range is defined in the write-up of the spell.

**Duration**: This describes how long the spell lasts. It is usually Instantaneous (I), meaning it takes effect and then immediately dissipates; Sustained (S), meaning the effect lasts as long as the caster keeps it in operation (dropping a sustained spell requires no use of an action; the magician simply stops holding it); Limited (L) means the spell has a set endpoint that the spell cannot be sustained beyond, but it can be dropped earlier than that if desired (the standard penalties for Sustained spells apply); and Permanent (P), meaning the effect does not dissipate and stays in place without any effort or focus on the part of the caster—the spell becomes a full part of the world.

**Type**: This is either M (for mana) or P (for physical). Mana spells interact solely with the astral plane; they may affect living beings, as living beings have an astral component, but they have no effect on nonliving, non-astral entities. Physical spells only affect the physical realm.

**Drain Value (DV)**: This is the base value that casters must resist to avoid experiencing drain. It can be increased if casters use Amp Up or Increase Area to adjust their spells. In essence this is the Rating that must be achieved on the Drain Test.

These are STATIS of every spell; each category may add other STATIS, which are described under each category’s heading.

### Sustained Costs

Magic is wearying and requires concentration, so if you are trying to keep a spell running while doing other things, there will be a price to pay due to the concentration and energy spent maintaining the spell. Whenever a spellcaster is sustaining a spell, they take a 1 DISADVANTAGE to any action test for each spell they sustain.

### Combat Spells

Simply put, Combat spells bring the pain. They’re what you cast to make enemies scared, unconscious, or dead.

There are two essential kinds of Combat spells: Direct and Indirect.

#### Direct Combat Spells
Direct Combat spells are when you shape mana in a way that it directly pummels the opposition—the magic is the damage. When you cast a Direct Combat spell, roll `Sorcery + Magic` opposed by the Rating of the target. Net Effct become damage and are added to any Amp Up damage the character chose. Damage from Direct Combat spells is not resisted.

#### Indirect Combat Spells
Rather than having the magic do the pummeling, Indirect Combat spells create an effect that causes the damage—igniting a fireball, say, or sparking a lightning bolt. To cast an Indirect Combat spell, roll `Sorcery + Magic vs. Rating`. Damage is caster’s `Magic divided by two (rounded up) + NET EFFECT + Amp Up damage`. Armor applies as usual for damage, as it would in physical combat. Indirect Combat spells frequently come with elemental effects.

In addition to normal spell STATIS, Combat spells list the type of damage done, whether it is Stun (S) or Physical (P).

##### Acid Stream
(Indirect Combat)
| RANGE | TYPE | DURATION | DV  | DAMAGE     |
| ----- | ---- | -------- | --- | ---------- |
| LOS   | P    | I        | 5   | P, Special |

#### Toxic Wave
(Indirect Combat, Area)
| RANGE   | TYPE | DURATION | DV  | DAMAGE     |
| ------- | ---- | -------- | --- | ---------- |
| LOS (A) | P    | I        | 6   | P, Special |

These spells shoot acid at targets, doing immediate damage while also doing Chemical damage and giving hit targets the Corroded status with a rating equal to NET EFFECT on the Spellcasting test. Acid Stream is a single-target spell, Toxic Wave is area effect.

#### Clout
(Indirect Combat)
| RANGE | TYPE | DURATION | DV  | DAMAGE |
| ----- | ---- | -------- | --- | ------ |
| LOS   | P    | I        | 3   | S      |

#### Blast
(Indirect Combat, Area)
| RANGE   | TYPE | DURATION | DV  | DAMAGE |
| ------- | ---- | -------- | --- | ------ |
| LOS (A) | P    | I        | 4   | S      |


A tricky little spell—the magic doesn’t hit the target, but it shapes the air to make the blow. The power of wind to shape rock formations is demonstrated solidly on the head of the target. Clout targets individuals, Blast is area effect.

#### Flamestrike
(Indirect Combat)
| RANGE | TYPE | DURATION | DV  | DAMAGE     |
| ----- | ---- | -------- | --- | ---------- |
| LOS   | P    | I        | 5   | P, Special |

#### Fireball
(Indirect Combat, Area)
| RANGE   | TYPE | DURATION | DV  | DAMAGE     |
| ------- | ---- | -------- | --- | ---------- |
| LOS (A) | P    | I        | 6   | P, Special |

A classic. When you think of hurting people with magic, the first thing that comes to mind is making fire explode in their faces. These are the spells that’ll get that done. Flamestrike hits individuals, Fireball is area effect. Both spells do Fire elemental damage and impose the Burning status with a rating equal to NET EFFECT on the Spellcasting test.

#### Ice Spear
(Indirect Combat)
| RANGE | TYPE | DURATION | DV  | DAMAGE     |
| ----- | ---- | -------- | --- | ---------- |
| LOS   | P    | I        | 5   | P, Special |

#### Ice Storm
(Indirect Combat, Area)
| RANGE   | TYPE | DURATION | DV  | DAMAGE     |
| ------- | ---- | -------- | --- | ---------- |
| LOS (A) | P    | I        | 6   | P, Special |

When every corp security goon you run into starts wearing flame-retardant underwear, it’s time to throw a changeup at them and hit them with the other temperature extreme. These spells blast targets with freezing cold, doing Cold elemental damage along with the normal damage and imposing the Chilled status for a number of combat rounds equal to NET EFFECT on the Spellcasting test. Ice Spear targets individuals, while Ice Storm is an area spell.

#### Lightning Bolt
(Indirect Combat)
| RANGE | TYPE | DURATION | DV  | DAMAGE     |
| ----- | ---- | -------- | --- | ---------- |
| LOS   | P    | I        | 5   | P, Special |

#### Lightning Ball
(Indirect Combat, Area)
| RANGE   | TYPE | DURATION | DV  | DAMAGE     |
| ------- | ---- | -------- | --- | ---------- |
| LOS (A) | P    | I        | 6   | P, Special |

It’s what deities from Zeus to Thor use to smite those who have it coming, which means it should be good enough for you, too. Lightning Bolt hits a single target with electricity, while Lightning Ball is area effect. Both spells do Electricity elemental damage, imposing the Zapped status for a number of turns equal to NET EFFECT.

#### Manabolt
(Direct Combat)
| RANGE | TYPE | DURATION | DV  | DAMAGE |
| ----- | ---- | -------- | --- | ------ |
| LOS   | M    | I        | 4   | P      |

#### Manaball
(Direct Combat, Area)
| RANGE   | TYPE | DURATION | DV  | DAMAGE |
| ------- | ---- | -------- | --- | ------ |
| LOS (A) | M    | I        | 5   | P      |

Essential spellcasting, shaping mana to crack skulls. Who can argue with this purity? Manabolt targets individuals, while Manaball is area effect.

#### Powerbolt
(Direct Combat)
| RANGE | TYPE | DURATION | DV  | DAMAGE |
| ----- | ---- | -------- | --- | ------ |
| LOS   | P    | I        | 4   | P      |

#### Powerball
(Direct Combat, Area)
| RANGE   | TYPE | DURATION | DV  | DAMAGE |
| ------- | ---- | -------- | --- | ------ |
| LOS (A) | P    | I        | 5   | P      |

The harsher version of Clout, Powerbolt smacks targets with Physical damage; Powerball does the same as an area effect.

#### Stunbolt
(Direct Combat)

| RANGE | TYPE | DURATION | DV  | DAMAGE |
| ----- | ---- | -------- | --- | ------ |
| LOS   | M    | I        | 3   | S      |

#### Stunball
(Direct Combat, Area)
| RANGE   | TYPE | DURATION | DV  | DAMAGE |
| ------- | ---- | -------- | --- | ------ |
| LOS (A) | M    | I        | 4   | S      |

Sometimes you take a little off the heater to catch the other guy off-balance. These spells channel mana in a way that hurts, but only to stun. Stunbolt hits individuals, Stunball is area effect.




## Chapter 10: The Matrix (Slimline)

When in the Matrix your own Talent is not nearly as important as the rating of your Cyberdeck.


### The Elevator Pitch

The Matrix is everywhere—cameras, doors, drones, host systems. As a decker (or a teammate with the right gear), you interact with it using the **same round structure and actions** as physical combat:

* **Action economy:** 1 **Major** + 1 **Minor** per round (plus extra Minors from initiative dice, as usual).
* **Initiative:** `Cyberdeck Rating + (Potential XD6) (+XD12 from gear)`
* **Tests:** You roll **Skill + STATIS** vs the target’s **Defense**. Success gives you what you want. Failing Detection pushes up your **Overwatch Score (OS)** until **Convergence** ends the party.

This chapter tells you **what to roll**, **what you can do**, **what pushes OS**, and **how IC fights back**—all with the same mechanics you already know from combat and magic.

---

### What You Need (Players)

* **Tools**
  * **Cyberdeck:** Grants **Attack** and **Sleaze** , **Data Processing**, **Firewall**, and **Program Slots** (see Equipment chapter).
  * **Cable (direct)** or **wireless** link to target. (Direct cable ignores Noise.)
* **Core skill:** **Computers**

**ASDF at a glance**
- Attack: Attacking Hosts, and IC. `Potential XD6 + Proficiency Attack + Computers vs. Rating`
- Sleaze: Bypassing systems, being Stealthy. `Potential XD6 + Proficiency Sleaze + Computers vs Rating`
- Data Processing: Working with Data, Files, Interfacing. `Potential XD6 + Proficiency Data Processing + Computers vs Rating`
- Firewall: Defense - Reduces incoming damage by Firewall Amount.

---

### Targets (GMs)

Everything you hack is either a **Device** or a **Host**.

#### Devices

* **Device Rating (R):** 1–6 (consumer to mil-spec).
* **Defense (most actions):** `Rating`.
* **Matrix Condition Monitor (CM):** `Rating x 2`.
* **Initiative (if it acts):** `Data Processing + (Potential XD6)` (often passive unless patrolled by IC).
* **Firewall** Reduces damage

#### Hosts

* **Host Rating (R):** 1–12.
* **Defense (most actions):** `Rating`.
* **Player Rolls Defense** `Rating`.
* **Matrix CM:** `R X 2`.
* **Initiative:** `Data Processing + (Potential XD6)`.
* **IC:** the host’s defenders. Deploy as OS rises (see **IC & Alerts**).

---

### Core Loop (Players & GMs)

#### 1) Roll Initiative

`Cyberdeck Rating + (Potential XD6) (+XD12 from gear)`. Hosts/IC roll `Data Processing + (Potential XD6)`.

#### 2) Take Actions

You get **1 Major** and **1 Minor** each round (plus extra Minors from initiative dice, as usual). Your actions are below. Hosts/IC act on their turn using the same structure.

#### 3) Handle Detection & OS

Quiet actions require a **Detection Test** (below). Loud actions always push **OS**. If OS hits **40**, **Convergence** bricks your deck, dumps you, and pings your location.

---

### Detection

After any **quiet** Matrix action (Probe, Snoop, Decrypt, Analyze, Spoof, etc.), make:

**Detection Test:** `Computers + Talent` **vs** `Base Rating= Target Rating Threshold + your current OS` to determine Rating.
* **On a success:** you stay hidden; no passive OS gain this round.
* **On a failure:** increase your **OS** by **NET EFFECT**.
> **Loud actions** (Brute Force, Matrix Attack, obvious Control) **skip** Detection and **still** add OS (see below).

---

### Overwatch Score (OS) & Convergence

Track a single number per intruding persona: **OS**.

**OS goes up when:**

* You **Brute Force** or **Matrix Attack:** +1 OS per **EFFECT** rolled by the **defender** (not net).
* You end a round **connected where you shouldn’t be:** +1 OS **unless** you passed a Detection Test that round.
* You’re in **cybercombat:** +1 OS each round (no test).
* You use a **program** that says it increases OS: +1 per action affected.

**OS 40 – Convergence:** your last-used hacking device is **bricked**, you suffer **dumpshock**, and your **physical location** is flagged for response.

> **Check OS (Minor):** If you have **Baby Monitor**, you always know OS. Without it, you can ask the system as a Minor, but that requires a **Detection Test**.

---

### Major Actions (Matrix)

> These mirror your combat Major Actions—declare, roll, resolve.

#### Brute Force (loud login)

Kick the door in to gain **User Access**.

* **Test:** `Attack + Computers` **vs** `Rating`.
* **On hit:** You gain **User** access (read/watch/basic control).
* **OS:** +1 per **defender’s EFFECT** (no Detection Test). Triggers IC if present.

> **Escalate to Admin:** After gaining User, make another Major test vs `Rating + 2`. On hit: **Admin Access** (configure, lock out, purge logs, spawn/kill processes).

#### Probe (quiet login)

Slip in unnoticed to gain **User Access**.

* **Test:** `Sleaze + Computers` **vs** `Rating`.
* **On hit:** Gain **User** access.
* **Then:** **Detection Test.** On success, you avoid passive OS this round.

> **Escalate to Admin:** As above, but this second test is also **quiet** and requires a **Detection Test**.

#### Matrix Attack (Data Spike / Program Attack)

Deal Matrix damage (and maybe biofeedback).

* **Attack Test:** `Attack + Computers` **vs** `Rating` (or IC’s listed defense).
* **On hit:** **Matrix DV** = `Attack + NET EFFECT`. Target reduces DV by **Firewall**; remaining boxes mark **Matrix CM**.
* **Biofeedback:** If using a program (Blackout/Biofeedback), target also takes **Stun (Blackout)** or **Physical (Biofeedback)** equal to the same DV.
* **OS:** +1 per **defender’s EFFECT** (no Detection Test).

#### Control Device (obvious seize)

Take over a camera, turret, maglock, or drone for a short window.

* **Test:** `Data Processing + Computers` **vs** `Rating `.
* **On hit:** You control it for **EFFECT + Data Processing** rounds (or until contested). You can issue normal commands.
* **OS:** +1 per **defender’s EFFECT** (no Detection Test).
* **Limits:** You can control up to **Data Processing** devices at once.

#### Snoop (quiet tap)

Read/record a device or node’s traffic.

* **Test:** `Sleaze + Computers` **vs** `Rating`.
* **On hit:** You can view/record its traffic while connected.
* **Then:** **Detection Test.**

#### Encrypt / Decrypt File (quiet)

* **Decrypt Test:** `Data Processing + Computers` **vs** `Encryption Rating`. On hit, you read or remove protection. Then **Detection Test**.
* **Encrypt Test:** `Data Processing + Computers` sets **Encryption Rating = EFFECT + Data Processing\`** on the file.

#### Spoof Command (quiet one-off)

Impersonate an authorized controller for one command.

* **Test:** `Sleaze + Computers` **vs** `Rating`.
* **On hit:** The command executes once.
* **Then:** **Detection Test.**

---

### Minor Actions (Matrix)

* **Operate Device (Matrix):** Toggle/peek a simple control you already own.
* **Jack Out:** Log off cleanly. If **link-locked**, you can’t Jack Out.
* **Swap Program:** Load/unload 1 program slot.
* **Check OS:** As noted above.

> **Link-Lock:** If you’re link-locked, you cannot **Jack Out** until you break the lock (see IC) or win **Major: Attack (Break Lock)** vs `Rating +2`. Breaking out from VR causes **dumpshock** (below).

---

### Dumpshock

If you leave VR without a graceful switch to AR (forced disconnect, Convergence, or Jack Out while link-locked), you take **dumpshock**:

* **DV:** 3S (wireless) or 3P (wired).
* **Aftershock:** You cannot gain **Bonus EFFECT** or use **Edge** for `(10 – Tenacity)` minutes.

---

### IC & Alerts (GMs)

Use **four** simple IC templates. Skin them however you like.

All IC use **Host STATIS** and act as independent combatants. Unless stated, they defend with `R + Firewall` and attack with `R + Attack`.

* **Striker (Killer/Blaster blend):**
  On hit: deal `R + NET EFFECT` **Matrix** damage.

* **Debuffer (Acid/Binder/Marker):**
  On hit: choose **Firewall, Data Processing, or Sleaze**; reduce that stat by **NET EFFECT** (to minimum 0) until the intruder leaves the host (recovers at **1 per minute**).

* **Control (Tar/Scramble):**
  On hit: apply **Link-Lock**. If the same target is hit again while link-locked, they must **Reboot** on their next turn unless they break the lock.

* **Black:**
  On hit: deal `R + NET EFFECT` **Biofeedback (Physical)** **and** `R` **Matrix** damage.

**Alert ladder (when to deploy IC)**

* **OS ≥ 10 (Alert):** Spawn **1 IC** (GM choice) on the intruder’s node.
* **OS ≥ 20 (Alarm):** Spawn **+1 IC**; **Control** attempts Link-Lock priority targets.
* **OS ≥ 30 (Lockdown):** Spawn **+1 IC**; **Black** may deploy.
* **OS ≥ 40 (Convergence):** As written—brick, dump, ping location.

> **Simple pacing alternative:** If you don’t want to track OS for a quick scene, spawn 1 IC the first time the decker uses **Brute Force** or **Matrix Attack**, 1 more if they do it again, and a **Black** IC if they keep pushing.

---

### Noise (Interference)

Apply **–1** per point of **Noise** to all Matrix tests. If Noise exceeds the device’s Rating, it cannot connect wirelessly. **Direct cable** = Noise 0.

Common sources: distance, dense walls/earth, water, jammers, spam zones. (Use the table from Equipment as-is.)

---

### Programs (quick list)

Your deck can run up to its **Active Program Slots**. Unless noted, effects are passive.

* **Stealth:** ADVANTAGE on **Detection Tests**.
* **Exploit:** ADVANTAGE on **your next** hacking action (declare first).
* **Armor:** +2 to your Firewall.
* **Browse:** On **Matrix Search**, gain **+1 Bonus EFFECT** (use now or lose).
* **Signal Scrubber:** –2 **Noise** (min 0).
* **Toolbox:** +1 **Data Processing**.
* **Virtual Machine:** +2 program slots; when you take Matrix damage, add **+1 unresisted** so no Firewall.
* **Blackout:** Your Matrix Attacks also deal **Stun** (biofeedback).
* **Biofeedback:** Your Matrix Attacks also deal **Physical** (biofeedback).
* **Overclock (Action):** Spend a slot to add **+2 Bonus EFFECT** to **one** Matrix action (declare first).
* **Baby Monitor:** Always know your **OS** (no action).
* **Rabbit:** Once per reboot, **reduce OS by 5** (Minor to trigger).

---

### Access Levels (what you get)

* **User:** read files, watch feeds, operate standard controls (open/close).
* **Admin:** reconfigure systems, lock out users, purge logs, spawn/kill processes, retask devices.

> **GM tip:** If stakes are high, require a second Major test (User → Admin) at `Rating x2`. Otherwise, grant Admin when fiction warrants (stolen creds, inside line, or great setup).
